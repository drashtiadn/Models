Dave, J@mdashHeard learned Counsel for the parties.\\n2. A short question involved in this appeal is with regard to the possession of Kill Nos. 13/4 and 14/1 of Rectangle No. 226 situated at Patti Tihav, Hodal.\\n3. A suit had been filed by the Respondents for possession against the present Appellant. The suit had been decreed and even the appeal filed has been dismissed. In these circumstances, the present appeal has been filed by the Appellant.\\n4. Learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant has submitted that the land in question has already been acquired under Notifications Under Section 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Moreover, the possession of the land in question had already been taken on 20th April, 1981 and compensation in respect of land in question had already been paid to the Respondents. Relevant Notifications Under Sections 4 and 6 have been placed on record.\\n5. In the aforesaid circumstances, in our opinion the suit for possession could not have been decreed, especially when the land had already been acquired.\\n6. For the aforesaid reason, the appeal is disposed of as allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside and suit is dismissed. No order as to costs.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997333.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-ORDER\\n1. The Appellant-company herein had imported a Steam Tube Dryer machinery/plant. Some dispute about the classification of the said machinery arose. The Revenue/Customs Authorities wanted the Appellant to pay higher duty which the Appellant was disputing. Insofar as the Custom Authorities are concerned, they had passed the orders calling upon the Appellant to pay the duty. Without paying this duty, the Appellant approached the High Court of Gujarat by way of writ petition with the prayer that the Appellant be allowed to get the said machinery released on payment of admitted amount of duty. On this writ petition, interim orders dated 4-5-1992 were passed permitting the Appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 70 lakhs as a condition for utilizing the machinery. We may record here that the Appellant had earlier furnished the Bank Guarantee in the sum of Rs. 1,45,27,079/-. The exact order which was passed on that date reads as under:-\\nAt the same time, it will also be proper if the Petitioner is directed to deposit some amount so that such money becomes available to the public Exchequer. In our opinion, it will be quite fair and just if the applicant is directed to deposit Rs. 70,00,000/- in this Court as a condition for utilising the machinery. As it will take some time for the applicant to install the machinery and commission it, we direct the applicant to start paying Rs. 70,00,000/- from 1st August, 1992, in four equal monthly installments. The bank guarantee, which the applicant is required to continue, will have to be reduced to the extent installments are paid by the applicant. The Respondents will be at liberty to withdraw the amount that may be deposited by the applicant in this Court on condition that whenever called upon to do so; they will repay that amount within the time that may be specified by this Court.\\nAs per the aforesaid order, the Appellant was required to pay a sum of Rs. 70 lakhs in four equal monthly installments starting from 1-8-1992. The Appellant deposited the first installment in the sum of Rs. 17.50 lakhs and defaulted in paying the remaining three installments. When this was brought to the notice of the High Court, the High Court vacated that order. Subsequently, order dated 1-8-1993 was passed which records the vacation of the order passed earlier and permitted the Customs Authorities to encash the Bank Guarantee.\\n2. The relevant portion of the said order reads as under:-\\nIn the result it is clarified and directed that the interim relief granted earlier has stood vacated pursuant to the order passed by this Court on September 18, 1992 inasmuch as the company has not deposited the amount of Rs. 70 lakhs as agreed and directed. It is further directed that the Union of India, Collector of Customs, Ahmedabad, and Assistant Collector of Customs, Kandla Port, Kutch, will be at liberty to encash the bank guarantee of Rs. 1,45,27,079/- (Rupees one crore forty five lakhs twenty seven thousand seventy nine only) furnished by the Company. However, it is clarified that the Department will give credit to the opponent-company of the amount paid by it as and by way of deposit in this Court. The applicant-Union of India will be at liberty to withdraw the amount deposited in this Court. Rule made absolute accordingly.\\n3. The Appellant filed the special leave petition against the said order which was also dismissed by this Court on 10-9-1993, inter alia, observing that it was not a case for interference with the order of the High Court as the Appellant had defaulted in the matter of payment of installments. The Bank Guarantee was, however, encashed to cover the amount up to Rs. 70 lakhs, as for encashment of the Bank Guarantee for the remaining amount, the Tribunal had granted stay which course of action was permitted by this Court as well dismissing the special leave petition of the Appellant.\\n4. The dispute of classification was ultimately settled by the Tribunal and as per that, a sum of Rs. 41,48,176/- became refundable to the Appellant being the difference between the duty payable and the duty actually paid.\\n5. This order attained finality. Thereafter, the Appellant filed application for refund of the said amount. This application was rejected by the proper officer on the ground that the doctrine of unjust enrichment would apply and since the Appellant could not satisfy the authorities that the burden was not passed on the ultimate consumers, the Appellant was not entitled to refund. Against the order, the Appellant approached the High Court. The High Court has, by the impugned judgment dated 15-12-2005, allowed the refund to the extent of Rs. 17.50 lakhs and rejected the prayer for the refund of balance amount of Rs. 23,98,178/-. The High Court has held that insofar as the amount of Rs. 17.50 lakhs is concerned, the sum was deposited pursuant to the interim orders dated 4-5-1992 and in that order, it was specifically mentioned that if the Appellant ultimately succeeds, the said amount would be refunded. Insofar as the balance amount is concerned, the prayer for refund is rejected on the ground that it has been an amount deposited pursuant to order passed by the Court and in fact, the Appellant was made to deposit this amount as it committed default of the conditional order passed and upon that, the interim orders were vacated and as a consequence thereof, the Department had encashed the Bank Guarantee. Therefore, insofar as this amount is concerned, doctrine of unjust enrichment was applied. Against this order, the present special leave petition was filed in which leave was granted and that is how the present appeal arises for consideration as to whether the High Court order rejecting the refund in the sum of Rs. 23,98,178/- is valid or not.\\n6. It cannot be disputed that the doctrine of unjust enrichment as incorporated by Section 27 of the Customs Act applies in all such cases. The only exception to the applicability of the aforesaid doctrine is that such amount is not paid as duty but has been paid by some interim orders in some proceedings by the Court as pre-deposit then it is not treated as duty. The endeavour of the Appellant is to submit that the aforesaid amount of Rs. 23,98,178/- was also a pre-deposit and, therefore, the High Court has committed error in not directing the refund thereof.\\n7. We are unable to accept the aforesaid submission. On the facts of the case, as is pointed out above, it is only Rs. 17.50 lakhs which was deposited by the Appellant pursuant to the interim orders of the Court. The Court had directed the Appellant to deposit Rs. 70 lakhs. As far as the balance amount is concerned that could not be deposited. It resulted in vacation of the stay order. Thus, once the stay order was vacated, it was open to the Department to recover the amount of duty which was payable as per the orders passed at that time. The amount was, thus, recovered on encashment of the Bank Guarantee by the Department and it was on the basis of the order passed by the Court. The Court had, after vacating the stay order, only permitted the Department to encash the Bank Guarantee. We, thus, are of the opinion that as far as refund of this amount is concerned, it had to be decided in the light of the doctrine of unjust enrichment which was clearly applicable. The order of the High Court is, therefore, without any blemish. This appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997337.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nAnil R. Dave, J@mdashLeave granted.\\n2. In all these appeals validity of a common judgment delivered in Civil Misc. Appeal Nos. 973-995 of 2005 and 539, 674 and 675 of 2006 dated 14th December, 2009 has been challenged.\\n3. The aforestated Civil Miscellaneous Appeals had been filed in the High Court of Judicature, Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad Under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \\'the Act\\') against a common order dated 14.03.2005 passed in different original petitions, by the XIV Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court (FTC), Hyderabad, dismissing the original petitions. The High Court vide its common judgment dated 14.12.2009 dismissed the aforestated appeals.\\n4. Being aggrieved by the said common judgment, the Appellants have approached this Court by way of these appeals.\\n5. The circumstances which gave rise to the present litigation in a nut-shell are as under:\\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh had launched a scheme named \\'ADARANA\\' under which certain tools of trade necessary for Blacksmiths, Carpenters, Dhobis etc. were to be supplied to the rural artisans. The Government was to purchase the tools through A.P. Backward Classes Cooperative Financial Corporation Limited, a corporation set up for welfare of the persons belonging to downtrodden classes, controlled by the Government and the \\'State\\' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. The Respondent-Corporation had invited quotations for supplying iron boxes, iron ring used for placing the iron; boxes, buckets and bannas required in the process of washing clothes etc. The present Appellants had agreed to supply the \"Razaka tools\" at a particular rate. We do not go into the details as to how the rates were finalized after several meetings held among the suppliers of the tools and the officers of the Respondent-Corporation. Suffice is to state at this stage that the suppliers, after several meetings and bargaining on both the sides had agreed to supply the tools at the rate of Rs. 165 per kg in six coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh namely, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari and Krishna, whereas for the other remaining districts, the rate had been fixed at Rs. 189.75 per kg and the above rates were exclusive of sales tax.\\n6. It is pertinent to note that when the agreement had been entered into with regard to supply of the tools by the Appellants to the Respondent-Corporation, it was also agreed among the parties that the rate at which the tools were offered was the lowest rate at which the suppliers were selling the tools of the same specification in the State of Andhra Pradesh.\\n7. Each Appellant (who has been referred to hereinafter as \\'the supplier\\') had also filed an undertaking stating that the prices quoted for supply of the tools were the lowest possible prices and that nowhere in Andhra Pradesh, the supplier was selling those products at prices lower than the price quoted. They had also undertaken to refund the difference of amount arising on account of any price difference in the price quoted by them and lower price offered by them in the open market in Andhra Pradesh in respect of the tools. One such undertaking dated 22.04.1999 given by one of the suppliers is reproduced herein below:\\n\\nUNDERTAKING\\n...I, Smt. CHEBROLU LAKSHMI SESHA KUMARI Proprietor of M/s. CHEBROLU ENTERPRISES, hereby declare that the prices quoted for the supply of our Products under ADARANA Project being implemented by Andhra Pradesh Backward Classes Cooperative Finance Corporation are the lowest possible prices and nowhere in Andhra Pradesh, we are selling our products with the same specifications at prices lower than the prices we have quoted under the said project.\\nI also undertake to refund/authorizes Andhra Pradesh Backward Classes Cooperative Finance Corporation to deduct excess amount paid to us on account of any price differential between higher prices quoted by us under ADARANA Project and lower prices offered in open markets in Andhra Pradesh....\\n8. Ultimately, the tools had been supplied by the suppliers to the Respondent-Corporation but it was found that the rates which had been charged by the suppliers were neither reasonable nor were the lowest at which the suppliers had sold their products similar to the one which they had supplied to the Respondent-Corporation and therefore, a dispute had arisen among the parties and the dispute had been referred to an Arbitral Tribunal, as agreed upon by the parties in the agreement dated 22.04.1999. The aforestated facts are not in dispute.\\n9. The learned Arbitral Tribunal ultimately came to the conclusion that the amount charged by the suppliers was excessive and therefore, made an Award dated 11.03.2002 in favour of the Respondent-Corporation to the effect that the suppliers were entitled to only Rs. 115 per kg towards price of the tools supplied by them and the claim exceeding the said amount had been rejected. It was also provided in the Award that the amount be paid with interest @ 6% per annum with effect from the date of claim petition i.e. 26th April, 2001 till the date of the payment.\\n10. The suppliers, being aggrieved by the Award, challenged the validity of the Award by filing original petitions before the Court of XIV Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court (Fast Track Court), Hyderabad under the provisions of Section 34 of the Act. After hearing the concerned parties, the said original petitions were dismissed and therefore, the suppliers approached the High Court with the above referred Civil Miscellaneous Appeals. The said appeals have also been dismissed and therefore, the present appeals have been filed by the suppliers before this Court.\\n11. The issues that fall for determination in these appeals are whether the suppliers had committed any fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation upon the Respondent-Corporation and whether any breach of contract had been committed either by the suppliers or by the Respondent-Corporation and further, whether the price fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal was reasonable or whether it was open to the Arbitral Tribunal to determine the price of the tools which had been supplied by the suppliers to the Respondent-Corporation.\\n12. We have heard the learned Counsel appearing for the parties at length. Upon hearing the learned Counsel, looking at the facts of the case and upon perusal of the relevant documents, including the agreement entered into between the suppliers and the Respondent-Corporation and the undertakings given by the suppliers in relation to supply of tools at the lowest price in the State, we are of the view that the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court is just and proper.\\n13. The price at which the tools had to be supplied had been fixed after negotiations and efforts were made to bargain on the subject of price by both the sides. Ultimately, a particular price had been determined as a result of the negotiations and the agreements with different parties had been entered into by the Respondent-Corporation for purchase of the tools.\\n14. The most important factor to be considered is the undertaking executed by each supplier to the effect that the tools which the said supplier had agreed to supply to the Respondent-Corporation was to be charged at the lowest rate at which the said supplier had sold his tools in the State of Andhra Pradesh. In other words, the supplier had not sold tools to anybody at a price lower than the price offered by the supplier to the Respondent-Corporation.\\n15. A copy of the undertaking executed by each supplier has been reproduced hereinabove. By virtue of the said undertaking, the suppliers had assured the Respondent-Corporation that the prices quoted for supply of the tools under ADARANA project were the lowest prices and that nowhere in Andhra Pradesh, they had sold their tools with the same specifications at prices lower than the prices which had been quoted by them for supply of the tools to the Respondent-Corporation for ADARANA project.\\n16. The effect of the undertaking was that if the rate which had been quoted by the suppliers in their agreement was more than the rate at which the said tools were sold by them in the State of Andhra Pradesh, the suppliers would refund the excess of price charged by them to the Respondent-Corporation.\\n17. The contract entered into by the suppliers on one hand and the Respondent-Corporation on the other was subject to the aforestated undertaking given by the suppliers. So, if the price quoted in the agreement is \\'X\\' per kg. for the tools supplied by the suppliers but if the tools of the same specifications were being sold by the suppliers in the State of Andhra Pradesh for a price lower than \\'X\\', say at price \\'Y\\', the Respondent-Corporation was supposed to pay rate \\'Y\\' and not \\'X\\', which had been agreed upon in the contract.\\n18. As there was a dispute with regard to the price and as the Respondent-Corporation had found out that rate quoted in the contract was higher than the rate at which the tools of the same specifications had been supplied by the suppliers in the State of Andhra Pradesh, the Respondent-Corporation had withheld the payment and in the circumstances the dispute had been raised and the suppliers had made their claim before the Arbitral Tribunal for payment of the remaining amount of price.\\n19. The learned Arbitral Tribunal considered all factors and the evidence which was adduced before it and came to the conclusion that the price which had been quoted by the suppliers and which had been agreed upon in the contract was higher than the price at which tools of the same specifications were sold by the suppliers in the State of Andhra Pradesh. In the circumstances, the learned Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the suppliers were entitled to the price of tools lesser than the one which had been agreed upon in the contract because the same quality of tools, which had been manufactured by the suppliers, were sold by them in the State of Andhra Pradesh at a lower price.\\n20. Determination of price in the aforestated manner is a question of fact. This Court or even the Appellate Court would not look into the finding of facts unless they are perverse. In the instant case, neither the City Civil Court in the proceedings filed before it Under Section 34 of the Act nor the High Court in the proceedings Under Section 37 of the Act could find anything wrong with the finding of facts arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal. This Court Under Article 136 of the Constitution of India would not like to interfere with the concurrent finding of facts, save in exceptional circumstances or unless the finding is perverse.\\n21. For the aforestated reasons, in our opinion, the determination of price by the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be faulted with.\\n22. The submission that the Arbitral Tribunal was not competent to determine the price is also not well founded. It is a finding of fact by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the price quoted was more than the price at which the same products/tools were supplied by the same supplier in Andhra Pradesh and therefore, after considering the relevant evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal determined a particular price i.e. Rs. 115 per kg. It cannot be said that determination of said price by the Tribunal in the aforestated circumstances was improper. The suppliers were bound as per the undertakings executed by them and as they had not acted as per their undertaking, it was open to the learned Tribunal to find out the correct lower price at which the tools of the same specifications, which were manufactured by the suppliers were available in the State of Andhra Pradesh and if in the aforestated circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal determines the price, in our opinion, it cannot be said that the Arbitral Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction.\\n23. In our considered opinion, no fraud had been committed as alleged. If higher price had been charged by the suppliers in the contract than the price at which their products were sold in the State of Andhra Pradesh, it cannot be said that the suppliers had committed any fraud while entering into the contract. The parties may determine the price in the manner agreed upon by them. In the instant case, there was an undertaking in the nature of a proviso that if the price fixed in the contract is more than the price at which tools of same specifications manufactured by the same supplier were available in the State, the supplier would be entitled to the lesser rate.\\n24. In our opinion, the manner of price determination by the Arbitral Tribunal, in the light of the undertakings executed by the suppliers, cannot be said to be irrelevant, incorrect or beyond jurisdiction.\\n25. For the aforestated reasons, we do not find any substance in these appeals and the same are dismissed with no order as to costs.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997340.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nVikramajit Sen, J@mdashThis Appeal assails the judgment dated 17.8.2005 pronounced by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter \\'SAT\\') directing the Appellant as well as the National Stock Exchange (NSE for brevity) to continue to grant the Respondent the \"fee continuity benefit\" as was available to them before the NSE decided to permit segmental surrender of membership to its members. In response to the fee demanded by the Appellant, namely the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI for short), the Respondent has paid, albeit under protest, the principal amount of Rs. 4,37,20,256/- together with Rs. 26,96,590/- being the interest accrued thereon. The factual matrix is that on 27.5.1994, Oracle Stocks and Shares Ltd. (hereinafter \\'Oracle\\') was registered by the NSE as a Trading member in two segments, that is the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) as well as in the Equity Market/Capital Market (EM/CM). Subsequently, on 14.1.1999, Oracle informed the NSE that it had entered into a 50:50 Joint Venture with Prebon Holdings B.V. (Prebon Group), namely Prebon Yamane (India) Ltd. (the Respondent), but restricted in respect to the WDM segment alone. NSE advised Oracle to bifurcate the WDM and the EM/CM segments whereupon Oracle forwarded a proposal in writing seeking the approval of NSE for the segregation of its Membership of WDM and of the EM/CM segments. By its letter dated 11.2.1999, NSE approved the proposal of Oracle for segregation but subject to certain conditions, inter alia, that if the trading member Oracle was desirous of surrendering its trading membership, both the entities viz. Oracle and the Respondent would have to surrender their respective memberships simultaneously. As is palpably apparent, NSE looked after its own financial interests by demanding Rs. 10 Lacs as approval fee together with an interest free security of Rs. 50 Lacs. Both entities were also required to maintain their shareholding pattern and comply with the net worth and all other requirements-Oracle in respect of corporate trading of the Capital Market and the Respondent in respect of the corporate trading in the WDM segment. The Respondent was also called upon to submit its shareholding pattern. It seems facially obvious to us that even the NSE was alive to the possibility of Oracle hiving off or transferring its WDM operations to the Respondent without complying with all the applicable Rules and Regulations. NSE maintained this position even later on, as is evident from a perusal of its letter to the Respondent positing that both memberships, though vesting in separate parties, were treated as \\'concomitant\\'. It is also relevant to underscore that the Appellant was not privy to these negotiations.\\n2. We must hasten to add that shortly subsequent to these events, the Appellant by its letter dated 4.4.1999 to the Respondent had granted registration to it \"as a stock broker\". The Appellant made its permission conditional inter alia, upon payment of fees for registration provided in the Securities and Exchange Board of India [Stock Brokers and Sub-Brokers] Regulations, 1992, the salient parts of which we shall extract for ease of reference. However, the relevant terms contained in the letter dated 4.4.1999 are these-\\n2 d) It shall pay the amount fees for registration in the manner provided in the Securities and Exchange Board of India [Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers] Regulations, 1992; and\\n5. You are now, in terms of clause [d] of the conditions of grant of registration certificate, required to pay the fees in accordance with Regulation 10[1] read with Schedule-III of the Securities and Exchange Board of India [Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers] Regulations, 1992 and remit the same through the stock exchange of which you are a member. All the stock exchange have been separately given necessary instructions in regard to collection of fees from the stock brokers and remittance thereof to the Board.\\n3. In this continuum NSE, in its letter dated 30.1.2002, again conveyed to the Respondent that both the memberships, though vesting in different entities, were \\'concomitant\\'. This reiterated stand of the NSE was submitted by the Respondent to the Appellant with a request to grant fee continuity benefit on the basis of the facts of the case. The Appellant has admitted that on receipt of this request from the Respondent, it recorded in its file notings that the two membership cards could be treated as composite and that the turnover of the two cards may be taken together for the purpose of turnover fees. It is not in dispute that till 2003 the Respondent had been availing of the benefits permissible under the fee continuity provisions. This position was also accepted by the Appellant, as both the membership cards were treated as composite and \\'concomitant\\' and the turnover of the two cards of Oracle and the Respondent were taken together on the predication that the Respondent\\'s WDM membership was a continuation of WDM segment of Oracle\\'s membership.\\n4. On 18.9.2003, the Respondent applied to the NSE for membership in the Derivatives Segment which the NSE, as per procedure, forwarded to the Appellant for its approval. On 24.6.2004, the Appellant returned the application and issued a provisional fee liability statement disclosing that after making the necessary adjustments of the amount paid with respect to its membership in the WDM Segment, there were unpaid dues in the name of the Respondent to the tune of Rs. 5,59,45,054 towards principal and interest. It was indicated that the application may be resubmitted only after payment of the outstanding fees. In its letter dated 23.8.2004 to the Respondent, NSE clarified that although segmental surrender of the trading membership was permissible since December, 2002, it had nevertheless to be kept in perspective that when the Respondent and Oracle had made the subject proposal in January, 1999, it was accepted on the condition that \"should any one of the entities decide to surrender their membership, then both the entities have to surrender their respective membership simultaneously\".\\n5. After receiving the provisional fee liability statement which stated a fee liability of Rs. 5,59,45,054, Respondent filed an Appeal on 8.11.2004 Under Section 15T of the SEBI Act, 1992. This was contested by the Appellant before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), which observed that at the time that NSE had granted fee continuity to the Respondent, there was no provision for segmental surrender, as a result of which, subject to certain conditions, fee continuity was granted to Respondent despite it being a new entity The SAT held that this letter did not have the effect of revocation or cancellation of the earlier conditions which were specifically imposed while granting assignment of WDM Segment from Oracle to the Respondent. Counsel for the Respondent brought to the notice of the SAT that the Respondent had already paid, albeit under protest pending disposal of the appeal, a sum of Rs. 4,37,20,256 towards the principal amount of the Appellant\\'s claim and a further sum of Rs. 26,96,590 as interest. However, the SAT directed the Appellant to refund both the amounts to the Respondent. Hence, the present Appeal.\\n6. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant has relied on Regulation 10 and Schedule III of the SEBI (Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992, which are reproduced for the facility of reference:\\n10. (1) Every applicant eligible for grant of a certificate shall pay such fees and in such manner as specified in Schedule III or Schedule IIIA, as the case may be: Provided that the Board may on sufficient cause being shown permit the stockbroker to pay such fees at any time before the expiry of six months from the date on which such fees become due.\\n(2) Where a stock-broker fails to pay the fees as provided in Regulation 10, the Board may suspend the registration certificate, whereupon the stock-broker shall cease to buy, sell or deal in securities as a stock-broker.\\nSCHEDULE III\\nRegulation 10\\nI. Fees to be paid by the Stock Broker.\\n1. Every stock broker shall subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Schedule pay registration fees in the manner set out below:\\n(a) where the annual turnover does not exceed rupees one crore during any financial year, a sum of rupees five thousand for each financial year;\\n(b) where the annual turnover of the stock-broker exceeds rupees one crore during any financial year, a sum of rupees five thousand plus one hundredth of one per cent of the turnover in excess of rupees one crore for each financial year;\\nxxx\\n(c) After the expiry of five financial years from the date of initial registration as a stock-broker, he shall pay a sum of rupees five thousand for every block of five financial years commencing from the sixth financial year after the date of grant of initial registration to keep his registration in force. (currently deleted)\\nxxx\\n4. Where a corporate entity has been formed by converting the individual or partnership membership card of the exchange, such corporate entity shall be exempted from payment of fee for the period for which the erstwhile individual or partnership member, as the case may be, has already paid the fees subject to the condition that the erstwhile individual or partner shall be the whole-time director of the corporate member so converted and such director will continue to hold a minimum of 40 per cent shares of the paid-up equity capital of the corporate entity for a period of at least three years from the date of such conversion.\\nExplanation: It is clarified that the conversion of individual or partnership membership card of the exchange into corporate entity shall be deemed to be in continuation of the old entity and no fee shall be collected again from the converted corporate entity for the period for which the erstwhile entity has paid the fee as per the Regulations.\\n7. The learned senior Counsel for the Appellant has contended that a membership of the Stock Exchange is an essential pre-requisite, for which the fee prescribed in Regulation 10 is payable by every such member. The amount that is payable as fee is determined as per the provisions under Schedule III. Emphasis has been placed on Clause 4 of Schedule III (supra) as it provides the only exception to the payment of fees. Facially, it appears to us, this exception has been carved out only for the enablement of persons who are vulnerable to unlimited personal liability in respect of their business debts, to avail of the advantages of converting their mode of transacting business into a corporate structure, provided this conversion is not misused to essentially transfer the business and yet escape payment of transfer fees; hence the insistence of retention of forty per cent share holding. It also manifests that for all other transfers, fees are payable to the Appellant, which depends on these collections for defraying its manifold expenditures. The legal propriety of these pecuniary demands by SEBI have received the attention of the Court and have been found proper in \\nB.S.E. Brokers Forum, Bombay and Others etc. Vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India and Others etc., \\n.\\n8. Reliance has also been placed on letter dated 4.4.1999 issued by the Appellant to the Respondent, by which a certificate of registration was issued to the Respondent subject, inter alia, to condition (d) which provides that the Respondent and similarly situated entities shall pay the amount of fees for registration in the manner provided in SEBI (Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations, 1992. This letter also requested the Respondent to study the Rules and Regulations carefully. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Respondent could not claim \"fee continuity\" on the basis of internal file notings. Reliance has been placed on the well entrenched legal principle that estoppel has no efficacy against a statute. \\nSethi Auto Service Station and Another Vs. Delhi Development Authority and Others, \\nclarifies this position thus-\\n13. Thus, the first question arising for consideration is whether the recommendation of the Technical Committee vide minutes dated 17th May, 2002 for re-sitement of Appellants petrol pumps constitutes an order/decision binding on the DDA?\\n14. It is trite to state that notings in a departmental file do not have the sanction of law to be an effective order. A noting by an officer is an expression of his viewpoint on the subject. It is no more than an opinion by an officer for internal use and consideration of the other officials of the department and for the benefit of the final decision-making authority. Needless to add that internal notings are not meant for outside exposure. Notings in the file culminate into an executable order, affecting the rights of the parties, only when it reaches the final decision-making authority in the department; gets his approval and the final order is communicated to the person concerned.\\n15. In \\nBachhittar Singh Vs. The State of Punjab, \\n, a Constitution Bench of this Court had the occasion to consider the effect of an order passed by a Minister on a file, which order was not communicated to the person concerned. Referring to the Article 166(1) of the Constitution, the Court held that order of the Minister could not amount to an order by the State Government unless it was expressed in the name of the Rajpramukh, as required by the said Article and was then communicated to the party concerned. The court observed that business of State is a complicated one and has necessarily to be conducted through the agency of a large number of officials and authorities. Before an action is taken by the authority concerned in the name of the Rajpramukh, which formality is a constitutional necessity, nothing done would amount to an order creating rights or casting liabilities to third parties. It is possible, observed the Court, that after expressing one opinion about a particular matter at a particular stage a Minister or the Council of Ministers may express quite a different opinion which may be opposed to the earlier opinion. In such cases, which of the two opinions can be regarded as the \"order\" of the State Government? It was held that opinion becomes a decision of the Government only when it is communicated to the person concerned.\\n16. To the like effect are the observations of this Court in \\nLaxminarayan R. Bhattad and Others Vs. State of Maharashtra and Another, \\n, wherein it was said that a right created under an order of a statutory authority must be communicated to the person concerned so as to confer an enforceable right.\\n9. The manner in which the Respondent understood its role and participation in the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment along with Oracle is comprehensively contained in the Respondent\\'s letter dated February 4, 2002. (This letter, although copiously relied upon by the parties in the course of argument was not available on the Court records. On 18.9.2015 we called upon the Appellant to furnish a copy thereof which was done by its learned Senior Counsel who has assured us that copies thereof had already been served on the learned Counsel for the Respondent) We think it appropriate to reproduce the contents thereof as it is a summation of the case of the Respondent:\\nThe National Stock Exchange (NSE) was formed in 1993-94 with a view to promote the Debt Market and Capital Markets. In the initial period they issued only memberships of the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segments. M/s. Oracle Stocks and Shares Limited (Oracle) applied for and was granted registration of the WDM segment of the NSE. Subsequently, the NSE issued membership in the Equity Market segment wherein the members who were holding membership of the WDM segment were automatically entitled to membership in this segment by paying an additional deposit.\\nOracle applied and was granted membership of the Equity Market (EM) segment. NSE did not issue a new registration number to Oracle and the company continued to do business in both the segments. Thus, the memberships of the WDM and the EM segments were treated as concurrent and there was no fresh registration with SEBI separately for the EM segment.\\nIn 1999, M/s. Oracle proposed to set up a 50:50 Joint Venture with the Prebon Yamane Group (leading brokers worldwide in Debt and Derivatives). Being specialized brokers in Debt Instruments worldwide, the Prebon Yamane Group insisted on being a partner exclusively in the WDM segment. Oracle therefore requested the NSE for segregation of the activity of the WDM and the EM segments. During that period, the NSE, as a matter of policy, was not issuing separate memberships for WDM and EM. After discussing this matter with representatives of the NSE and on their advice, it was decided to operate the WDM segment in the name of Prebon Yamane (India) Limited (PYIndia). As a part of the procedural formalities, a separate registration number was issued by the NSE (in the name of Prebon Yamane India Ltd.). Oracle would continue to hold 50% of the subscribed capital in the new entity.\\nAlthough Oracle and PYIndia were given two separate registration numbers for EM and WDM respectively, the NSE did not collect the deposit of Rs. 15 million which it would normally have done for new WDM members. Instead, the NSE merely transferred (without refunding the amount to Oracle) a part of the total deposits of Oracle, amounting to Rs. 10 million, in favour of PYIndia. PYIndia did not bring in fresh deposits for the WDM membership of NSE.\\nThus, NSE segregated the quantum of deposits paid in 1994 to M/s. Oracle and PYIndia to allow each of these entities to broke in Equity and Debt markets respectively. It was also stipulated by the NSE that neither of these entities can surrender one of the memberships without surrending the other. Undertakings to this effect by way of Board resolutions were taken individually from M/s. Oracle and PYIndia. Thus, in essence, the NSE treated both these companies as one composite member with the same promoter group.\\nThe NSE treats the induction of the Prebon Group and the consequent assignment of the WDM segment of Oracle Stocks & Shares Ltd. to Prebon Yamane India Ltd. as a continuation of the original WDM membership that was granted to M/s. Oracle Stocks & Shares Ltd. The view of the NSE in this regard, confirming that both the memberships are concomitant, is enclosed herewith.\\nIn view of the facts mentioned above and the NSE\\'s view in this regard, we would request you to give the status of fee continuity to the composite membership taken by M/s. Oracle and PYIndia.\\nIn other words, if Oracle has paid turnover fees from 1994, and the broking business has commenced from 1994, any fees be levied in either Oracle and/or PYIndia for the balance period, as a composite entity.\\n10. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent has contended that transfer from one juristic person to another is not the appropriate test and that since the Regulations employ the term \"entity\", it is necessary to determine whether the entities are essentially the same. Senior Counsel has submitted that since Oracle, who was an existing member, had a 50% stake in the Respondent, in effect the Respondent was another manifestation or avatar of Oracle. Further, the Appellant had conducted inspections of the Respondent but had not raised any issue or recorded any objections at that time. Reliance has been placed on the letter dated 30.1.2002 issued by the NSE to the Respondent, which had stated that as per the policies of the NSE, segmental surrender of trading membership was not permitted, and therefore the assignment of WDM segment to the Respondent has been treated as a continuation of the WDM membership that was originally granted to Oracle. It has been strenuously contended that the Appellant had a change of mind and heart consequent upon the issuance of its Circular dated 28.3.2002 which stated that in case a broker had more than one registration certificate from any stock exchange, he would be required to pay fees as per the Regulations for each and every certificate that he held. The Circular further stated that in the event of a broker holding only one Registration Certificate but more than one card on any Exchange, registration fee would be payable on the registration certificate and not on the number of cards held by the broker, and the broker\\'s turnover would be reckoned as the aggregate turnover of all cards. It appears that this provision had been relied upon in the judgment dated 3.6.2010 in WP (C) No. 17349/2004, which was struck down by the Delhi High Court in Association for Welfare of Delhi Stock Brokers v. Union of India, and an Appeal there against is pending before this Court. However, we find that issue which were in contemplation in those proceeding are dissimilar to what we have in hand.\\n11. Reliance has also been placed on the affidavit filed by the Appellant before the SAT. Therein the Appellant admitted that the Respondent had applied for fee continuity vide letter dated 4.2.2002 which had enclosed the letter of the NSE confirming that both the memberships had been considered concomitant by it. The Appellant, based on the same, approved in the file that the two cards could be treated as composite for all practical purposes and the turnover of the two cards may be taken together for the purpose of ad-valorem fee. We have already noted that Sethi Auto Service Station enunciates that file notings cannot be relied upon with the intent of binding the concerned Authority or Department.\\n12. Counsel for the Appellant has pointed out that the Respondent has not paid fee as per Schedule III, Clause 1(c). The Respondent only paid the basic fee indicating that its turnover for the financial year was not beyond Rs. 1 Crore. However, the fixed basic fee of Rs. 5000 was paid by the Respondent in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Had the Respondent indeed believed that it had been granted continuity, then as per Clause 1(c) of Regulation 10, the Respondent would have paid Rs. 5000 only once, for the block of 5 years. Furthermore, to prove that the Respondent was under no misconception with regard to it not having been granted \"fee continuity\", reference was made to two letters dated 4.2.2002 and 18.9.2003. Both these letters were applications seeking grant of fee continuity. Thus, the Respondent was never under an understanding that it had been granted fee continuity.\\n13. After considering the submissions of the learned Senior Counsel for both parties and appreciating the facts of the case, it is evident to us that as per Clause 4 of Schedule III, the Respondent was not an \\'entity\\' as envisaged in the Regulations as would be entitled to \"fee continuity\" or exemption from payment of fees. The Regulation 4 clearly refers to a newly formed entity through conversion from either a sole proprietorship or a partnership to a limited Company, which alone has been bestowed the benefit of continuity. Given that the Respondent is barred by the provisions, the Appellant\\'s internal file notings are of no consequence and the Appellant is not estopped from coming to a contrary conclusion. The Respondent\\'s argument that the Appellant experienced a change of heart after the issuance of the Circular dated 28.3.2002 is untenable, because if that was indeed what the Respondent believed, it would not have written a letter requesting fee continuity on 4.2.2002, a date prior to the issuance of the circular dated 28.3.2002. Thus, the Respondent has failed to prove that it believed it was granted fee continuity, in light of its letter to the Appellant requesting the same. Further, it appears to us that the Respondent was an entity quite distinct from Oracle, with the consequence that it would be bound to pay the fee in accordance with Schedule III, Clause (a) or (b) as the case may be, and would not be entitled to claim the advantage of Clause (c). In fact, this is the very understanding of the Respondent since fees were deposited by them under Clause (a) in sharp contradistinction of Clause (c).\\n14. The amounts deposited by the Respondent have been properly calculated. The Respondent is not entitled to any refund therefrom. The Appeal is accordingly allowed. The Interim Order granted by the Court stands recalled.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997342.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nR. Banumathi, J@mdashChallenge in this appeal is the judgment dated 29.05.2003 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Criminal Appeal No. 39-DBA of 1995, wherein the High Court reversed the judgment of acquittal passed by the Sessions Judge, Sirsa and convicted the Appellant Under Section 15 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 (NDPS Act) on account of having been found in possession of poppy husk and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for twelve years and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,50,000/- and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.\\n2. Briefly stated case of the prosecution is that on 16/17.09.1990 mid night at about 12.15 a.m., Chander Singh-SI alongwith Ram Singh-ASI and team of police personnel with Government Jeep No. HNN 3108 and a private jeep were holding Nakabandi on both sides of Kacha path leading to village Kingre from G.T. Road for detection of the contraband. At that time, a tractor No. RJV 6299 with trolley was heading towards the road from the village and the same was stopped and the Appellant was apprehended and he was inquired about the gunny bags of poppy husk lying in the trolley. The Appellant was served with a written notice to the effect that as to whether he wanted to be examined before First Class Magistrate or Gazetted Officer in connection with the recovery of poppy husk from his trolley. The Appellant had shown faith in Sub Inspector-Chander Singh and as per rules Sub-Inspector searched the trolley. Thirty three yellow coloured gunny bags containing poppy husk were recovered from the trolley attached to tractor and on weighing the bags, each bag was found to be of forty kilograms i.e. in total about thirteen quintals and twenty kilograms of poppy husk was recovered. From each bag, sample of hundred grams was taken out and parcels were made and remaining poppy husk lying in the gunny bags were sealed with seal \\'CS\\' and were seized and taken into police possession alongwith the said tractor with its trolley. On the basis of rukka, case bearing No. 234 dated 17.09.1990 Under Sections 15, 16, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act was registered at P.S. Sadar, Dabwali. Subsequently, samples were sent for chemical analysis and were found to be poppy straw. On completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed Under Sections 15 and 16 of the NDPS Act.\\n3. To substantiate the charges against the Appellant, the prosecution examined only one witness Ram Singh-ASI-PW-1, affidavits of MHC Mohinder Singh and Constable Om Prakash and also the documents including FSL Report were filed. Sessions Judge, Sirsa vide its judgment dated 22.04.1994 acquitted the Appellant observing that no other witness except Ram Singh-PW-1 was examined and that Ram Singh-PW-1\\'s evidence was not trustworthy to base the conviction. Aggrieved by the verdict of acquittal, State preferred appeal before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The High Court vide impugned judgment reversed the judgment of acquittal and convicted the Appellant Under Section 15 of NDPS Act and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment and imposed fine as aforesaid. Aggrieved, the Appellant has filed the instant appeal.\\n4. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant Mr. Anmol Rattan Sidhu submitted that Chander Singh-SI was an important witness as he was the person who held the Nakabandi and prepared rukka and non-examination of Chander Singh is fatal to the prosecution case. It was contended that testimony of Ram Singh-PW-1 does not warrant credibility as he could not have been present at two places i.e. at the place of arrest of Appellant-Baldev Singh and also at the place of arrest of one Bhoop Singh in connection with another FIR bearing No. 235 dated 17.09.1990 at P.S. Sadar at 5.30 a.m. in which one Bhoop Singh was arrested while carrying opium which renders the presence of Ram Singh-ASI in the place of recovery highly doubtful which aspect was not properly appreciated by the High Court and the High Court erred in convicting the Appellant on the sole testimony of Ram Singh-ASI.\\n5. Per contra, learned Counsel for the Respondent Mr. Amit Kumar, Additional Advocate General submitted that the recovery was at odd hours in night, prosecution cannot be expected to examine independent witness and public witness, who happened to reach the spot when requested to join the police party but they refused to join. It was further contended that the sole testimony of Ram Singh-ASI is trustworthy and the Appellant had not offered any satisfactory explanation for the huge quantity of contraband and the High Court rightly reversed the acquittal and the verdict of conviction warrants no interference.\\n6. We have carefully considered the rival contention advanced by the parties and perused the impugned judgment and material on record.\\n7. Case of prosecution hinges on the testimony of sole witness Ram Singh-PW-1. Undisputedly, Ram Singh-PW-1 was the member of the Nakabandi party headed by Chander Singh-SI on the night of 16/17.09.1990. Admittedly, Ram Singh signed all the documents and also witness to the recovery memo. Even after searching cross-examination, evidence of Ram Singh-PW-1 remains unshaken.\\n8. On the midnight of 16/17.09.1990, when the police party was holding Nakabandi on both sides of Kacha path leading to village Kingre from G.T. Road, the tractor was intercepted and the driver of the tractor-Appellant was apprehended under suspicion at odd hours of midnight, prosecution cannot be expected to examine independent witnesses. In his cross-examination, PW-1 stated that two persons had come at the place of Nakabandi in the midnight and they were asked to join, but they refused to join. In the circumstances of the case, when there is satisfactory explanation for non-examination of independent witnesses, conviction can be based solely on the testimony of official witnesses if evidence of such official witnesses inspires confidence.\\n9. The accused sought to place reliance on the decision in Gyan Singh and Ors. v. State of U.P. 1995 Supp (4) SCC 658, wherein this Court observed that conviction cannot be based on uncorroborated testimony of official witnesses. But this judgment has no relevance in the facts and circumstances of the case as in Gyan Singh\\'s case (supra), this Court focused on the need to have independent witnesses in the odd hours in night as at the distance of 100 yards there was habitation but in the instant case no such material is brought on record to show that there was human habitation in the nearby place.\\n10. There is no legal proposition that evidence of police officials unless supported by independent evidence is unworthy of acceptance. Evidence of police witnesses cannot be discarded merely on the ground that they belong to police force and interested in the investigation and their desire to see the success of the case. Prudence however requires that the evidence of police officials who are interested in the outcome of the result of the case needs to be carefully scrutinized and independently appreciated. Mere fact that they are police officials does not by itself give rise to any doubt about their creditworthiness.\\n11. Observing that no infirmity is attached to the testimony of police officials merely because they belong to police force and that conviction can be based on the testimony of police officials in \\nGirja Prasad (Dead) by LRs. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, \\n, it was held as under:\\n[24] In our judgment, the above proposition does not lay down correct law on the point. It is well-settled that credibility of witness has to be tested on the touchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that in a given case, a Court of Law may not base conviction solely on the evidence of Complainant or a Police Official but it is not the law that police witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other independent evidence. The presumption that every person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a Police Official as any other person. No infirmity attaches to the testimony of Police Officials merely because they belong to Police Force. There is no rule of law which lays down that no conviction can be recorded on the testimony of Police Officials even if such evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of prudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the Court is convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of truth, conviction can be based on such evidence.\\n[25] It is not necessary to refer to various decisions on the point. We may, however, state that before more than half-a-century, in the leading case of \\nAher Raja Khima Vs. The State of Saurashtra, \\n, Venkatarama Ayyar, J. stated:\\nThe presumption that a person acts honestly applies as much in favour of a police officer as of other persons, and it is not judicial approach to distrust and suspect him without good grounds therefor. Such an attitude could do neither credit to the magistracy nor good to the public. It can only run down the prestige of the police administration.\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n[26] In \\nTahir Vs. State (Delhi), \\n, dealing with a similar question, Dr. A.S. Anand, J. (as His Lordship then was) stated:\\nWhere the evidence of the police officials, after careful scrutiny, inspires confidence and is found to be trustworthy and reliable, it can form basis of conviction and the absence of some independent witness of the locality to lend corroboration to their evidence, does not in any way affect the creditworthiness of the prosecution case.\\n12. Testimony of Ram Singh-PW-1 and evidence on record amply establishes physical possession of the contraband by the Appellant. The Appellant being the driver of the vehicle by all probabilities must have been aware of the contents of the bags transported in the trolley attached to the tractor. Once the physical possession of the contraband by the accused has been proved, Section 35 of the NDPS Act comes into play and the burden shifts on the Appellant-accused to prove that he was not in conscious possession of the contraband. Section 35 of the NDPS Act reads as under:\\n35. Presumption of culpable mental state.--(1) In any prosecution for an offence under this Act which requires a culpable mental state of the accused, the Court shall presume the existence of such mental state but it shall be a defence for the accused to prove the fact that he had no such mental state with respect to the act charged as an offence in that prosecution.\\nExplanation.--In this section \"culpable mental state\" includes intention, motive knowledge of a fact and belief in, or reason to believe, a fact.\\n(2) For the purpose of this section, a fact is said to be proved only when the court believes it to exist beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely when its existence is established by a preponderance of probability.\\nExplanation to Sub-section (1) of Section 35 expanding the meaning of \\'culpable mental state\\' provides that \\'culpable mental state\\' includes intention, knowledge of a fact and believing or reason to believe a fact. Sub-section (2) of Section 35 provides that for the purpose of Section 35, a fact is said to be proved only when the Court believes it to exist beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely when its existence is established by a preponderance of the probability. Once the possession of the contraband by the accused has been established, it is for the accused to discharge the onus of proof that he was not in conscious possession. Burden of proof cast on the accused Under Section 35 of the NDPS Act can be discharged through different modes. One of such modes is that the accused can rely on the materials available in the prosecution case raising doubts about the prosecution case. The accused may also adduce other evidence when he is called upon to enter on his defence. If the circumstances appearing in the prosecution case give reasonable assurance to the Court that the accused could not have had the knowledge of the required intention, the burden cast on him Under Section 35 of the NDPS Act would stand discharged even if the accused had not adduced any other evidence of his own when he is called upon to enter on his defence.\\n13. In \\nAbdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri Vs. State of Gujarat, \\n, this Court has clearly held that where an accused admits that narcotic drugs were recovered from bags that were found in his possession at the time of his apprehension, in terms of Section 35 of NDPS Act the burden of proof is then upon him to prove that he had no knowledge that the bags contained such a substance. This Court then went further on to explain as to the standard of proof that such an accused is expected to discharge and the modes vide which he can discharge the said burden. In paras (21) and (22) of the said judgment, this Court held as under:\\n21. No doubt, when the Appellant admitted that the narcotic drug was recovered from the gunny bags stacked in the autorickshaw, the burden of proof is on him to prove that he had no knowledge about the fact that those gunny bags contained such a substance. The standard of such proof is delineated in Sub-section (2) as \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". If the court, on an appraisal of the entire evidence does not entertain doubt of a reasonable degree that he had real knowledge of the nature of the substance concealed in the gunny bags then the Appellant is not entitled to acquittal. However, if the court entertains strong doubt regarding the accused\\'s awareness about the nature of the substance in the gunny bags, it would be a miscarriage of criminal justice to convict him of the offence keeping such strong doubt undispelled. Even so, it is for the accused to dispel any doubt in that regard.\\n22. The burden of proof cast on the accused Under Section 35 can be discharged through different modes. One is that he can rely on the materials available in the prosecution evidence. Next is, in addition to that, he can elicit answers from prosecution witnesses through cross-examination to dispel any such doubt. He may also adduce other evidence when he is called upon to enter on his defence. In other words, if circumstances appearing in the prosecution case or in the prosecution evidence are such as to give reasonable assurance to the court that the Appellant could not have had the knowledge or the required intention, the burden cast on him Under Section 35 of the Act would stand discharged even if he has not adduced any other evidence of his own when he is called upon to enter on his defence.\\n(Emphasis added)\\n\\n14. In the light of the above principles, what is to be examined in the present case is whether the accused-Appellant has been able to discharge the burden of proof cast upon him Under Section 35 of the NDPS Act. The Appellant has raised doubts about the prosecution case mainly on two aspects viz.; (i) evidence of sole witness Ram Singh-ASI is not trustworthy and (ii) non-examination of Chander Singh-SI who prepared the rukka.\\n15. To assail the prosecution case, it was contended that Ram Singh-PW1\\'s testimony cannot be relied upon as PW-1 has stated that he remained busy in the investigation in the present case for 7-8 hours but the fact that Ram Singh has been associated in the investigation of another FIR No. 235 dated 17.09.1990 relating to Police Station Sadar Dabwali at 5.30 a.m. in which one Bhoop Singh was arrested while carrying one kilogram and hundred grams opium, which according to the Appellant, renders the presence of Ram Singh-ASI in the instant case highly doubtful. The learned Sessions Judge accepted the above submission of the Appellant to hold that evidence of Ram Singh-ASI does not inspire confidence. As observed by the High Court, the learned Sessions Judge overlooked that there is no evidence as to the distance between the places of recovery in both the cases. As observed by the High Court, it has come on record that in both the FIRs the place of occurrence has been stated as \"in the area of Village Kingre, at a distance of 18 K.M. towards the East, Deh. No. 33\". It appears from the above entry in the FIR, that the place of occurrence was the same for both the FIRs recorded on that night. The case relating to Bhoop Singh in FIR No. 235 resulted in acquittal. Referring to the acquittal of Bhoop Singh, High Court observed that the same would warrant an inference that what is incorporated in FIR No. 234 is incorrect and that defence has not been able to make any dent in the testimony of Ram Singh-ASI to discard his evidence as untrustworthy. We find no reason to take a different view.\\n16. Contention at the hands of the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant is that non-examination of Chander Singh-SI who prepared rukka and who investigated the case raises serious doubts about the prosecution case. Material on record would show that Chander Singh-SI who investigated the case was not examined by the prosecution in spite of several opportunities. No doubt, it is always desirable that prosecution has to examine the investigating officer/police officer who prepared the rukka. Mere non-examination of investigating officer does not in every case cause prejudice to the accused or affects the credibility of the prosecution case. Whether or not any prejudice has been caused to the accused is a question of fact to be determined in each case. Since Ram Singh-PW-1 was a part of the police party and PW-1 has signed in all recovery memos, non-examination of Chander Singh-SI could not have caused any prejudice to the accused in this case nor does it affect the credibility of the prosecution version.\\n17. In his statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure, no plea has been taken that the Appellant was not in conscious possession of the contraband. The Appellant has only pleaded that he being falsely implicated and that a false case has been foisted against him in the police station. In his statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure, the Appellant had not stated anything as to why would the police foist the false case against the Appellant. It is to be noted that huge quantity of poppy straw was recovered from the possession of the Appellant. Admittedly, the police officials had no previous enmity with the Appellant. It is not possible to accept the contention of the Appellant that he is being falsely implicated as it is highly improbable that such a huge quantity has been arranged by the police officials in order to falsely implicate the Appellant.\\n18. In his statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure, the Appellant denied the allegations against him and stated that he has been falsely implicated and to substantiate his defence, the Appellant adduced two documents Exs. D1 and D2. Ex. D1 is a certified copy of the FIR No. 235 dated 17.09.1990 Under Sections 17 and 18 of the NDPS Act relating to case against Bhoop Singh and Ex. D2 is a copy of the judgment acquitting the said Bhoop Singh. of course, case against Bhoop Singh originated from FIR No. 235 dated 17.09.1990 registered at 5.30 a.m. ended in acquittal but acquittal of Bhoop Singh in the said case does not render the prosecution case against the Appellant-Baldev Singh doubtful.\\n19. From the evidence led by the prosecution, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused being the driver of the tractor was in conscious possession of the thirty three bags of poppy husk in the trolley attached to the tractor. Upon appreciation of evidence, High Court rightly reversed the acquittal and convicted the Appellant Under Section 15 of the NDPS Act. The occurrence was in the year 1990 and the Appellant has suffered a protracted proceeding of about twenty five years. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the Appellant is reduced from twelve years to ten years.\\n20. The conviction of the Appellant Under Section 15 of the NDPS Act is confirmed and the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the Appellant is reduced to ten years and the appeal is partly allowed. The Appellant is on bail and his bail bonds are cancelled. The Appellant be taken into custody forthwith to serve the remaining part of the sentence.\\n'),\n",

Civil Appeal No. 1435 of 2008 seeks to challenge the order dated 05.05.2006 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Review Application No. 161 of 2006 arising out of the judgment and order dated 07.02.2006 in so far as LPA No. 21 of 1999 was concerned. Since both these appeals arise out of the same proceedings they are being dealt with and disposed of by this common judgment.\\n2. The Appellant was appointed as Assistant Aerodrome Officer with Director General Civil Aviation (\"DGCA\" for short) on 04.03.1974 and was promoted to the post of Aerodrome Officer in 1980. He was transferred to Leh by order dated 23.05.1985 but said transfer could not take place as proper accommodation was not available at Leh and the Appellant continued to be stationed at Delhi. In the year 1985, the National Airport Authority Act, 1985 (Act 64 of 1985) was enacted which came into operation w.e.f. 07.12.1985 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The Act provided for establishment of an authority namely National Airport Authority (\"NAA\" for short) for the management of Aerodromes and Civil Enclaves whereat domestic Air Transport Services are operated or intended to be operated and for management of all communication stations and matters connected therewith. Section 13(3) of the Act which is relevant for our purposes is quoted hereunder:\\n13. Transfer of assets and liabilities of the Central Government to the Authority-\\n...\\n...\\n(3) Every employee holding any office under the Director-General of Civil Aviation immediately before the commencement of this Act solely or mainly for or in connection with such affairs of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation as are relevant to the functions of the Authority under this Act as may be determined by the Central Government shall be treated as on deputation with the Authority but shall hold his office in the Authority by the same tenure and upon the same terms and conditions of service as respects remuneration, leave, provident fund, retirement or other terminal benefits as he would have held such office if the Authority had not been constituted and shall continue to do so until the Authority duly absorbs such employee in its regular service.\\nProvided that during the period of deputation of any such employee with the Authority, the Authority shall pay the Central Government in respect of every such employee, such contribution towards his leave, salary, pension and gratuity as the Central Government may, by order, determine:\\nProvided further that any such employee, who has, in respect of the proposal of the Authority to absorb him in his regular service, intimated within such time as may be specified in this behalf by the Authority his intention of not becoming a regular employee of the Authority, shall not be absorbed by the Authority.\\n3. The record indicates that NAA was established w.e.f. 01.06.1986 and the employees holding office under the DGCA as described in Section 13(3) of the Act were en masse sent on deputation to NAA. On 31.03.1986 the Appellant had written to the DGCA stating that he would like to continue his services in the office of the DGCA. Immediately upon establishment of NAA, the Appellant again wrote to the DGCA on 04.06.1986 stating that he did not wish to join NAA and his services be retained with the DGCA.\\n4. By order dated 11.07.1986 the Appellant was transferred to Civil Aerodrome, Varanasi and it was directed that he be relieved from his posting at Delhi and he must join the post at Varanasi w.e.f. 15.7.1986. The Appellant immediately wrote on 12.07.1986 to the Chairman, NAA and stated:\\n...Moreover, I beg to draw your kind attention to my letter dated 31st March 1986 addressed to DGCA in which I had already requested him that I would like to continue my services in the DGCA so I would not join the NAA.\\nIn view of the above it is requested that my transfer order may please be deferred till the end of the next academic session (April 87) in the mean time I may be absorbed in the DGCA. The reply to my request as contained in the above letter and subsequent reminder dated 4.6.86 (copy attached) is being awaited.\\n5. The Appellant did not join the services at Varanasi and remained absent. By his representation dated 02.09.1986, he stated that he was making all efforts to see that his option of not joining NAA was fulfilled. He also stated:\\n...In any event I would like to request your good-self to at least give me my posting at Delhi until the next academic session whereafter the undersigned may be transferred to any station as per law.\\n6. By internal communication dated 04.02.1987 the office of the DGCA wrote to the Chairman of NAA requesting to relieve the Appellant so that he could be posted in the office of the DGCA treating the case to be of reversion to his parent office. However, as a matter of fact the Appellant was not relieved and continued to remain on deputation with NAA. On 11.03.1987 NAA issued a memorandum stating that the request of the Appellant for being posted in the office of the DGCA could not be acceded to and that the Appellant was required to join his post at Varanasi immediately. In spite of such clear intimation, the Appellant did not join his post at Varanasi and continued to remain absent. On 23.02.1988, i.e. nearly after a year, the Appellant again wrote that the insistence of NAA that he should join at Varanasi was uncalled for as the DGCA had already asked NAA to relieve him so that he could join the office of the DGCA.\\n7. Sometime in October 1989, option as contemplated under Second Proviso to Sub-Section 3 of Section 13 of the Act was extended to many employees whose services stood deputed with NAA. However, such option was not extended to the Appellant because of his continued absence from duty.\\n8. On 11.02.1991 a memorandum was issued to the Appellant enclosing statement of Articles of Charges framed against him for his continued absence from 15.07.1986. The substance of imputation of alleged misconduct along with list of documents was submitted and disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him. In his reply, the Appellant submitted inter alia that he had applied for repatriation which request was accepted by the DGCA on 04.02.1987 and as such the Appellant could not and ought not to be proceeded against. The Enquiry Officer by his report dated 31.08.1992 concluded that the Appellant was transferred to Varanasi w.e.f. 15.07.1986 and was relieved on 15.07.1986 for joining Civil Aerodrome, Varanasi, that the Appellant did not report at Varanasi upon his transfer, that there was no application on record to show that he had taken any kind of leave and that he was absenting from duty since 15.07.1986.\\n9. On 10.10.1992 the Appellant submitted his representation against the enquiry report dated 31.08.1992. Thereafter, the Chairman of NAA being the competent authority recommended major penalty and sent the matter to the relevant Ministry. While the matter was so pending, the services of the Appellant were placed at the disposal of the DGCA by relieving him vide letter dated 13.03.1995 addressed by the Administrative Directorate.\\n10. The Appellant thereafter filed Writ Petition No. 4402 of 1995 in the High Court of Delhi submitting that since 04.02.1987 his services all the while were with the DGCA, that the entire disciplinary proceedings were without jurisdiction, that in any case on and with effect from 13.03.1995 his services were placed at the disposal of the DGCA and that despite such order he was not allowed to join his posting with the DGCA. The Appellant therefore prayed that he be allowed to join his duty, that NAA be directed to disburse his full pay and allowances from July 1986 onwards and that the DGCA be directed to release his pay and allowances for the period from 04.02.1987. While opposing the petition, it was submitted that by virtue of the statutory scheme the Appellant stood deputed with NAA but he had continued to remain absent with a view to avoid transfer out of Delhi. It was further submitted that so long as he was not relieved by NAA, the Appellant continued to be in the service of NAA.\\n11. The writ petition was allowed by a Single Judge of the High Court vide judgment and order dated 02.11.1998. It was observed that Section 13(3) of the Act could not be read to deny the right of an employee which he had on account of his service conditions with his parent department under the Fundamental Rules and that it was his right to ask for reversion from deputation to join the parent department. It was further observed that non-repatriation of the Appellant after 04.02.1987 was illegal and uncalled for and that on and with effect from 04.02.1987 the Appellant stood relieved from the services under NAA and consequently the entire disciplinary proceedings were without jurisdiction. Allowing the writ petition, it was ruled that the Appellant was entitled to all consequential benefits and promotion in the office of the DGCA.\\n12. NAA and the DGCA being aggrieved, filed LPA Nos. 21 and 314 of 2000 respectively before the Division Bench of the High Court which were allowed vide judgment and order dated 07.02.2006. It was held that by virtue of Section 13(3) of the Act the services of the Appellant were automatically placed on deputation with NAA and he could not go back to the parent department unless relieved by NAA. It was further observed that unless and until relieved by a specific order, the Appellant continued to be in the services of NAA and he could not have absented himself from his duties in NAA. The Division Bench thus set aside the judgment and order passed by the Single Judge and dismissed the writ petition.\\n13. The Appellant filed Review Application No. 161 of 2006 in so far as the judgment and order of the Division Bench in LPA No. 21 of 2006 was concerned. Said review application was dismissed by the Division Bench vide order dated 05.05.2006. The Appellant had also filed Review Application No. 209 of 2006 against the judgment and order dated 07.02.2006 in so far as LPA No. 314 of 2006 was concerned. Said review application was dismissed by the Division Bench vide its order dated 02.06.2006. The judgment and orders in LPA Nos. 21 of 1999 and 314 of 2000 and aforesaid review applications are under challenge in these civil appeals. It may be mentioned that on 02.08.2006 the Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation, passed an order imposing the penalty of \"dismissal from service\" on the Appellant.\\n14. Appearing for the Appellant, Mr. V. Shekhar, learned Senior Advocate submitted that the learned Single Judge was right in his assessment about the effect of deputation and the rights of the Appellant and that the Appellant stood repatriated to the DGCA w.e.f. 04.02.1987 and as such the subsequent proceedings were without jurisdiction. While opposing these contentions, Ms. Vibha Dutt Makhija, learned Senior Advocate relied upon Section 13(3) of the Act and submitted that the services of the Appellant stood statutorily deputed with NAA and unless he was specifically relieved, he continued to be in the services of NAA and was not justified in remaining absent unauthorisedly.\\n15. The effect of Section 13(3) of the Act is clear and every employee holding any office under the DGCA in connection with the functions of the Authority under the Act stood statutorily deputed with NAA and continued to be on deputation till duly absorbed in its regular service by NAA. The expression used in said Section is \"shall be treated on deputation\" which unequivocally shows mandatory nature of the statutory provision. Neither the employee nor the DGCA could stop such statutory deputation or have any say in the matter. Second Proviso to Sub-Section 3 of Section 13 of the Act contemplates exercise of discretion, within such time as may be specified, by the employee in respect of proposal of the Authority to absorb him. The discretion would therefore be available at a later point in time as and when the proposal for absorption is taken up for deliberation or consideration and not at the first stage when the services stood statutorily deputed with NAA.\\n16. The services of the Appellant having thus been deputed with NAA, the Appellant ought to have joined his post at Varanasi and was not justified in remaining absent unauthorisedly. The fact that the Appellant prayed for disbursement of pay and allowances from NAA with effect from 15.07.1986 itself shows that he was conscious of the jural relation and that with effect from 15.07.1986 his services were with NAA. The tenor of his letters dated 04.06.1986, 11.07.1986 and 02.09.1986 further shows that he was well aware that his services stood deputed with NAA. In the circumstances and more particularly after 11.03.1987 the Appellant was not at all justified in remaining absent. His continued absence from 15.07.1986 disentitles him from any relief.\\n17. The reliance on internal communication dated 04.02.1987 is completely misplaced. By said communication, the request was definitely made by the DGCA that the Appellant be relieved to enable him to be repatriated to the parent department. However, such request was not acceded to and it was specifically conveyed to the Appellant by communication dated 11.03.1987 that he should join his duty at Varanasi. In the face of such communication, the Appellant could not have absented himself and if he did so, he alone would be responsible for the consequences.\\n18. As the services of the Appellant were deputed with NAA, it was definitely competent to initiate the disciplinary proceedings for his continued absence. The order of dismissal passed on 02.08.2006 is not under challenge in these appeals. As regards the entitlement to seek disbursement of pay and allowances from NAA, in our view, the Appellant is not entitled to any relief. We do not find any error in the assessment made by the High Court in the judgment and order under appeal. We, therefore, dismiss these appeals leaving it open to the Appellant to raise any challenge as regards the order of dismissal, if so advised. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997329.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nShiva Kirti Singh, J@mdashThe leading matter - C.A. No. 6036 of 2012 as well as C.A. No. 6061 of 2012 are statutory appeals arising out of a common order dated 2.7.2012 passed by Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (for short, \\'APTEL\\') whereby pleas Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 to explain the alleged delay in preferring claims by the common Respondent - M/s. Lanco Kondapalli Power Ltd. (for brevity referred to as \\'M/s. LANCO\\') a power generating company before the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as \\'the Commission\\') has been accepted and as a result the main claim in the leading matter relating to Bill for Capacity Charges and in the other appeal for Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for 2001-2005 have been remanded for a follow up order by the Commission on the actual claims and interest. In respect of MAT, a concession on merits was recorded in respect of period 2006-2009 and for the earlier period (2001-2005) the contest was confined only to issue of limitation, as evidenced by Original Order of Commission dated 13.6.2011. Hence, through a SLP leading to C.A. No. 6835 of 2015, the Appellant has chosen to make a direct challenge to aforesaid order to explain and overcome the alleged concession in respect of claim for reimbursement of MAT for the entire period of 2001-2009. C.A. No. 6138 of 2012 is a statutory appeal to again challenge MAT for 2006-2009 but directed against appellate order dated 20.7.2012 by APTEL. The last matter, C.A. No. 9304 of 2013 arises out of a SLP against the original order of Commission dated 8.8.2013 relating to MAT claim for the period 2009-2012. Since issues are same or similar between the same Appellant and Respondent in all these appeals, they have been heard together and shall be governed by this common judgment. Unless otherwise indicated the facts have been noted from the records of the main matter, i.e., C.A. No. 6036 of 2012.\\n2. Instead of merits of bills raised by M/s. LANCO for capacity charges the issue of limitation has assumed greater significance and has thrown up two important points. First, whether the Limitation Act is applicable to a claim before the Commission and if the answer is in positive, then second, whether APTEL\\'s order reversing the views of Commission and accepting claim Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act is in accordance with law or not. It is not in dispute that if the order of APTEL is upheld, the issue of correctness or validity of capacity charges will stand remanded for decision by the Commission in accordance with law. So far as claim of M/s. LANCO for reimbursement of MAT for the period 2001-2005 is concerned, it shall stand rejected if APTEL\\'s order on the issue of limitation is reversed, otherwise such claim for the aforesaid period as well as for later period upto 2012 will be governed by the present judgment on the issue of legality and admissibility of claim for MAT.\\n3. Before adverting to the issues noticed above and the rival contentions, it will be useful to notice the essential facts relevant for deciding the issues. M/s. LANCO is engaged in the generation and sale of electricity. Its Registered Office is at Hyderabad and it has set up its power project at Kondapalli Industrial Development Area in Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. A.P. Power Co-ordination Committee, the Appellant No. 1, as the name suggests, was constituted on 07.06.2005 to ensure coordination between the four distribution companies of Andhra Pradesh who arc Appellant Nos. 3 to 6. M/s. Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (APTRANSCO) is the second Appellant. At the relevant time the Appellant No. 2 was engaged in procurement of power for the Distribution Companies. In the first phase of power sector reforms, Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board was unbundled into Generation and Transmission Corporation and subsequently the four Distribution Companies were notified by the Government on 31.3.2000 on account of unbundling of the Transmission Corporation in the subsequent phase of reforms.\\n4. There is no dispute between the parties that the erstwhile A.P. State Electricity Board had invited bids for short gestation power projects. M/s. LANCO also submitted its bid which was accepted by the Board and approved by the Government of Andhra Pradesh leading to a Power Purchase Agreement (for brevity, \\'PPA\\') dated 31.3.1997. M/s. LANCO then set up a 355 MW (ISO) Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant. The completion of the plant took more than the scheduled period of 16 months. It is not necessary to go into reasons for the delay in the present proceeding. It will suffice to note that M/s. LANCO declared 25.10.2000 as the date of commissioning of their project but this was not accepted as the Commercial Operation Date (COD) by APTRANSCO. However, M/s. LANCO continued to generate power and delivered it to grid. It raised bills from 19.9.2000. While the charges for the energy delivered were accepted, the bill for capacity charges was disallowed on the ground that it was not in accordance with the PPA. On 8.9.2003 M/s. LANCO issued a notice of arbitration under Article 14 of the PPA. There is some dispute as to whether this notice was only for invoking the mechanism for informal dispute resolution or also a notice for resolution of dispute by Arbitration. The Appellants through a reply dated 24.9.2003 requested for an ordinary meeting to discuss pending problems before considering the request for arbitration. On 14.10.2003 M/s. LANCO wrote a letter intimating the nomination of its Company\\'s Secretary as its representative to participate in the proceeding for informal dispute resolution required by Article 14.1. It requested the other side to designate their representative and to intimate the date and venue of the meeting. The Appellants through a letter dated 25.11.2003 designated their Chief General Manager to act as their representative but the meeting scheduled could not take place. On 26.3.2004, M/s. LANCO issued another notice for arbitration and intimated the name of Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy as its arbitrator. Through a letter dated 8.4.2004, APTRANSCO raised various grounds in support of its stance that the arbitration clause was not enforceable, particularly in the light of Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003.\\n5. M/s. LANCO did not accept the stand of Appellants and filed an Arbitration Application bearing No. 31 of 2004 on 27.4.2004 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad Under Section 11(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking appointment of arbitrator for APTRANSCO so that the disputes raised by it could be resolved through arbitration. APTRANSCO contested the maintainability of arbitration proceedings on various grounds including Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003. While the matter before the High Court was still pending, the scope and effect of Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act was decided by a judgment of this Court dated March 13, 2008 in the case of \\nGujarat Urja Vikash Nigam Ltd. Vs. Essar Power Ltd., \\n. This Court held that all disputes between the licencee such as the Appellants and generating companies such as M/s. LANCO require adjudication only by the State Commission which is alone competent to either adjudicate the disputes or refer them for arbitration and to appoint arbitrator. It was clearly held that it is the State Commission or its nominee Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003 and not the Chief Justice or his nominee Under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 who will have the authority to appoint an arbitrator if it decides to refer the disputes to arbitration. This Court further clarified that except the power of appointing arbitrator getting shifted to the State Commission, conduct of arbitration even Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act would be governed by provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Only in cases of conflict the Electricity Act would prevail.\\n6. In view of law settled by the judgment in the case of Gujarat Urja (supra), the Arbitration Application No. 31 of 2004 was closed by the High Court on 18.3.2009 with liberty to M/s. LANCO to approach the Commission Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act. M/s. LANCO filed O.P. No. 33 of 2009 before the Commission on 5.6.2009 to claim capacity charges on the basis of bills raised from 15.9.2000 onwards to 11.1.2001. The Appellants resisted the claim inter alia on the ground of limitation. The Appellants preferred a specific application for rejecting the O.P. No. 33 of 2009 on the ground of limitation. M/s. LANCO preferred a reply in which Section 14 of the Limitation Act was invoked for seeking exclusion of time when the arbitration proceeding had remained pending with the High Court in the form of Arbitration Application No. 31 of 2004. The Commission rejected the claim by order dated 13.6.2011 on the ground of limitation by holding that the time spent in the arbitration proceedings did not merit exclusion Under Section 14 of the Limitation Act because it had not been pursued in good faith. M/s. LANCO preferred Appeal No. 129 of 2011 before APTEL. That appeal was allowed by the impugned judgment presently under appeal, dated 2.7.2012. APTEL reversed the findings of the Commission on the issue of limitation and directed the Commission to pass appropriate follow up order on the actual claims and interest.\\n7. So far as claim of M/s. LANCO for reimbursement of MAT for various periods is concerned, the claim for the period 2001-2005 was rejected by the Commission on the ground of limitation but it got revived on account of common appellate order by APTEL dated 2.7.2012 and after the remand only a consequential order is required to be passed by the Commission. For other periods, the claim for reimbursement of MAT has been allowed in favour of M/s. LANCO. The Commission allowed the claim for the periods 2006-2009 and 2009-2012 on account of its earlier order in respect of similar claim in another case which elicited a concession by the counsel for the Appellants, although in the written statement before the Commission the Appellants had seriously contested such claim on merits. It is contended by Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant that the concession was misconceived and unauthorized. Learned Senior Counsel for M/s. LANCO, Mr. Sundaram, fairly conceded that the issue relating to claim for reimbursement of MAT may be heard and decided by us on merits and accordingly the parties have been heard in detail on the merits of such claim for the entire period, i.e., from 2001 to 2012. But in case the claim of MAT for 2001-2005 is held by us to be barred by limitation, it will not be considered on merits.\\n8. Appearing for the Appellants, learned senior advocate Mr. V. Giri pointed out that in the impugned order under appeal APTEL has not considered the claim of capacity charges on merits and therefore this Court is not required to go into facts for deciding the merits of bills for capacity charges. On the issue of limitation he contended that there was no issue raised before the Commission that bar of limitation as per Limitation Act is not applicable to the proceedings before the Commission. He referred to the arguments advanced on behalf of M/s. LANCO before APTEL to highlight that even in appeal it claimed exclusion of time spent in arbitration proceedings Under Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act and hence this Court should not allow M/s. LANCO to now urge that the Limitation Act cannot apply and hence there will be no bar of any limitation in preferring a claim before the State Commission. We have noticed that in para 28 of the judgment under appeal APTEL has noted that the Appellant No. 1 (M/s. LANCO) does not seriously dispute the fact that the Limitation Act would be applicable to the present case. But learned Counsels have conceded that the issue whether Limitation Act is applicable or not is one of law and accordingly the parties have advanced detailed submissions on this issue. Hence we propose to consider these submissions also.\\n9. From the above stand of the parties, the following issues emerge for our consideration and adjudication:-\\n(i) Whether the Limitation Act, 1963, particularly Section 3 and the Schedule will apply to any action instituted before the Commission Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, 2003?\\n(ii) Whether the impugned order passed by APTEL permitting application of principles emerging from Section 14 of the Limitation Act, is against Law so as to warrant interference?\\n(iii) And whether on merits the claim for reimbursement of MAT is in contravention of relevant terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)?\\n10. At this juncture, relevant provisions or articles of PPA need to be noticed. They are as follows:\\nArticle 3.8 - Claims for Taxes on Income\\nAny advance Income tax payable for the Project in any month supported by a certificate of a chartered accountant approved by the Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be reimbursed by the Board. After the tax assessment is completed for any year, and the liability thereon is determined by the taxation authorities in India, the excess or shortfall in the tax liability so determined will be adjusted in the supplementary bill (as defined in Article 5.5) for the succeeding month or on the due date of payment thereof, whichever is later, subject to Article 3.9. Tax to be reimbursed will be calculated on the income from the project only, and calculated on the assumption that the Company is engaged solely in the ownership, design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the Project and will not include tax reimbursements of the previous year.\\n5.5. - Supplementary Bills\\nFor payments due to the Company for reimbursement of taxes on income, incentives or taxes and duties levied on generation and/or sale of electricity, payments for periods of political Force Majeure affecting either Party or Non-Political Force Majeure affecting the Board or any other adjustments or payments due to the Company hereunder, the Company shall present a supplementary bill, in such form as may be mutually agreed upon by the Board and the Company, (duly supported by supporting data). Each supplementary bill shall be payable by the Board on the Due Date of Payment, except in case of supplementary bill for taxes on income. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date when income tax is required to be paid by the Company, the Company shall submit to the Board a supplementary bill for the same. This bill shall be payable by the Board within twenty-five (25) days of its presentation to the Board by the Company or at least five (5) days before the date on which the tax is required to be paid by the Company, whichever is later.\\n5.7 - Billing Disputes\\nNotwithstanding any dispute as to all or any portion of any bill submitted by the company to the Board, the Board shall pay the full amount of the bill provided that the amount of the bill is based on (a) a meter reading that has either been signed by both Parties or certified by the Company with respect to the Board\\'s refusal to sign within three (3) days of the meter reading date and (b) the provisions of this Agreement. The Board shall notify the Company of any disputed amount, and the Company shall rectify the defect or otherwise notify its rejection of the disputed amount, with reasons, within five (5) days of the reference by the Board, falling agreement on which the provisions of Article 14 shall apply with respect thereto. If the resolution of any dispute requires the Company to reimburse the Board, the amount to be reimbursed shall bear interest at the Working Capital Rate applicable to the Board from the date of payment by the Board to the date of reimbursement. The Board may not dispute any amount after sixty (60) days following the Due Date of Payment therefore.\\n11.1 - Definition of Law\\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Law\" means the constitution of India and any act, rule, regulation, directive, notification, order or instruction having the force of Law enacted or issued by any competent legislature, or Government Agency.\\n11.2 - Definition of Change in Law\\nFor the purposes of this agreement, \"Change in Law\" means\\n(i) any enactment or issue of any new Law,\\n(ii) any amendment, alteration, modification or repeal of any existing Law or any new or modified directive or order thereunder,\\n(iii) any change in the application or interpretation of any Law by a competent legislature or Government Agency in India which is contrary to the existing accepted application or interpretation thereof, in each case coming into effect after the date of this Agreement, provision for which has not been made elsewhere in the Agreement.\\n11.4 - Additional/Reduced Expenditures or Other Increased/Reduced Costs due to a Change in Law or Change in Permits\\n(a) Within sixty (60) days after the COD of the first Generating Unit or the end of any Tariff Year, the Company shall determine after accounting for the net economic effects on the Company during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or, as the case may be, such Tariff Year of any Changes in Law or Changes in Permits, based on an accounting conducted by an independent chartered accountant reasonably acceptable to the Board. If as a result of such accounting, the company suffers an increase in costs or a reduction in after-tax cash flow or any other net economic burden which it would not have experienced but for such changes in Law or Changes in Permits (taking into account the reasonable costs of financing of any capital improvement in the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or, as the case may be, such Tariff Year), the aggregate economic affect of which exceeds the equivalent of Rupees three (3) crores per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period prior to the COD of the first generating unit and Rupees one (1) crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period after the COD of the first Generating Unit, during any Tariff Year (excluding cost adjustments in respect of Changes in Law or Changes in Permits from any prior period), the Company may notify the Board of any proposed amendments to this Agreement required to put the Company in the same economic position it would have occupied in the absence of such cost increase reduction in the net after-tax cash flow or any other economic burden. Such notice shall be accompanied by a certification of the Company\\'s independent chartered accountant and a reasonably detailed explanation of certification of any officer of the Company respecting the basis for such net economic burden increase. The amount of an net economic burden claimed by the Company shall be net of any insurance proceeds received in respect thereof.\\n(b) Within sixty (60) days after the COD of the first Generating Unit or the end of any Tariff Year, if after accounting as provided in subsection (a) for the net economic effects on the Company during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or as the case may be, such tariff year of any changes in law or Changes in Permits, the Company experiences a reduction in costs or an increase in after-tax cash flow or any other net economic benefit which it would not have experienced but for such Changes in Law or Changes in Permits, the aggregate economic effect of which exceeds the equivalent of Rs. 3 crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or Rupees one (1) crore per 100 MW or pro-rata for any part thereof, following the COD of the first Generating Unit, during any tariff Year, the Company shall provide to the Board results of such accounting together with a certificate of the Independent chartered accountant and the Board, in response thereto may notify the company of any proposed amendments to this Agreement required in its good faith judgment to put the Company in the same economic position it would have occupied in the absence of such cost reduction, increase in the net after-tax cash flow or any other economic benefit. Such notice shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed explanation of a certification of an officer of the Company respecting the basis for such decrease.\\n(c) Only increased costs which are necessarily and unavoidably incurred in complying with or as a direct result of the Changes in Law or Changes in Permits taking into account, all reasonable steps which may be taken by the Company to minimize such increased costs, shall be considered as increased costs for the purposes of this Article.\\n(d) As soon as practicable during the period prior to the COD of the first Generating Unit or any Tariff Year after the Company becomes aware of any Change in Law or Change in Permits which could reasonably be expected to give rise to an increase/reduction in costs or reduction/increase in after-tax cash flow pursuant to paragraph (a) and (b), the Company shall provide an interim notice thereof to the Board describing, to the extent possible, the expected effect on the costs and the cash flow of the Company. The Company shall consult with the Board regarding such increased expenditures and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to implement the Board\\'s recommendations, if any, to minimize such increased expenditures consistent with Prudent Utility Practices and the Company\\'s obligations under this Agreement. If prior to the end of any Tariff year the Company demonstrates on the basis of a certification of its chartered accountant that any Change in Law or Change in Permits would result in the Company\\'s being unable to meet its payment obligations to its lenders under the Financing Documents on a current basis, then in addition to the Company\\'s right under Sub-section (a) but notwithstanding the time period for exercising such rights specified therein, the Company shall be entitled to propose amendments to this Agreement as provided in Sub-section(a) and the Parties shall consider such proposal as provided in subsection (e) below, provided that any benefits which the Company is eligible to receive under subsection (a) shall be reduced by any benefits received by the Company prior to the end of the relevant period under this subsection.\\n(e) Within thirty (30) days after receiving any proposal pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (d), the Parties shall meet and agree on either amendments to this Agreement or alternative arrangements to implement the foregoing. If no such agreement has been reached within ninety (90) days after any meeting pursuant to Article 11.3(a), (b) or (d), as the case may be, the proposals of the Parties shall be submitted to the Independent chartered accountant referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), as the case may be.\\n14.1 - Informal Dispute Resolution\\n(a) Each Party shall designate in writing to the other Party a representative who shall be authorized to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement in an equitable manner.\\n(b) If the designated representatives are unable to resolve a dispute under this Agreement within fifteen (15) days, such dispute shall be referred by such representatives to a senior officer designated by the Company and a senior officer designated by the Board, respectively, who shall attempt to resolve the dispute within a further period of fifteen (15) days.\\n(c) The Parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to attempt to resolve all disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in good faith, and further agree to provide each other with reasonable access during normal business hours to any and all non-privileged records, information and data pertaining to any such dispute.\\n14.2 - Arbitration\\n(a) In the event that any dispute is not resolved between the Parties pursuant to Article 14.1, then such disputes shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration. It is specifically understood and agreed that any dispute that cannot be resolved between the Parties, including any matter relating to the interpretation of this Agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration irrespective of the magnitude thereof, and the amount in dispute or whether such dispute would otherwise be considered justiciable or ripe for resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall remain in full force and effect pending the award in such arbitration proceedings, which award shall determine whether and when termination of this Agreement if relevant shall become effective.\\n11. Although, we were taken through various other Articles of PPA but it is not imperative to reproduce all such provisions. Article 3.1 provides for capacity charge which is required to be computed as per Article 3.2 and is meant to be paid by the Board. This is in respect of the Cumulative Available Energy provided by the Project in respect of any tariff year, upto (but not exceeding) an amount calculated on the basis of Prescribed Plant Load factor. Since the issue of capacity charge is not required to be addressed by us on merits, further details need not detain us. Clause 3.8 has been read over again and again because it is of immense significance in deciding the issue relating to MAT. Article 5 contains various Sub-articles relating to billing and payment. They provide for monthly tariff bills which are payable by the Board or the licensee on the Due Date of Payment. The supplementary bills are covered by Article 5.5. They cover different items and are required to be supported by supporting data. Such bills are also payable on the Due Date of Payment, except the supplementary bill for taxes on income which is to be submitted at least 30 days prior to the time when the income tax is required to be paid by the generating company. Such bill is payable by the Board within 25 days of presentation or at least 5 days before the date on which the tax is required to be paid by the company, whichever is later.\\n12. Article 5.7 relates to billing disputes and it refers to the provisions of Article 14 which governs Arbitration including Informal Dispute Resolution. Article 11 caters to the effects of Change in Law upon the rights and liabilities of the parties. This has assumed relevance in the present context on account of stand taken by the Appellant that MAT does not fall under Article 3.8 governing claims for Taxes on Income but under Article 11.4 which provides an altogether different procedure for making claim for additional costs by the company on account of any Change in Law etc. In this context it may usefully be noted that Article 1 of PPA contains definitions for the purposes of the agreement. Article 1.2 adopts definition of several terms as defined in the Indian Electricity (Supply Act) 1948 and set out in Schedule B to the Agreement. Article 1.4 contains various general provisions such as - unless the context otherwise requires, the singular shall include plural etc. and vice versa and that \".......a reference to any Law shall be construed as a reference to such Law as from time to time amended or re-enacted.\"\\n13. Mr. Giri drew our attention to various provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 particularly to Section 86 providing for various functions of a State Commission which include the function under Clause (f) in Sub-Section (1) empowering the Commission to \"adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration.\" He also referred to Section 94 which vests the Commission, for purposes of any inquiry or proceedings under this Act, with same powers as are vested in Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in respect of various matters such as summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath; discovery and production of any document etc; receiving evidence on affidavit; requisitioning of any public record; issuing commission for the examination of witnesses; reviewing its decisions, directions and orders; and any other matter which may be prescribed by the Commission. The Commission shall also have powers to pass suitable interim order and authorize any suitable person to represent the interest of the consumers in the proceedings before it. Section 95 declares that all proceedings before the Commission shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code and it shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of Sections 345 and 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Section 158 is a solitary provision in Part XVI which provides for arbitration under the heading \"Dispute Resolution\". According to Section 158, any matter directed to be determined by Arbitration, unless there is expressed provision to the contrary in the license of a licensee, shall be determined by such person or persons as the Commission may nominate in that behalf on the application of either party; but in all other respects the Arbitration shall be subject to the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\\n14. On the basis of powers and functions of the Commission highlighted above and on account of law declared in Gujarat Urja (supra) as well as in Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corpn. Ltd. v. PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd., (2014) 11 SCC 53, the contention of Mr. Giri is that in discharge of its functions to adjudicate all disputes between the licensees and generating companies and/or in referring a dispute to arbitration Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act, the Commission deserves to be treated as a substitute and therefore equivalent of civil court for the purpose of attracting the bar of limitation provided under the Limitation Act, 1963. According to him the law laid down by this Court that Limitation Act applies only to civil courts in the strict sense of the term requires reconsideration in an appropriate case but in the present matter, since in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) it has been categorically held that the State Commission discharges judicial functions and judicial power of far reaching effect and has essential trapping of the Courts, the same should be sufficient to make the Limitation Act applicable to petitions or applications that come before the Commission requiring adjudication even of matters arising purely out of contract like in the present case and not from the statutory provisions of the Electricity Act. He also advanced a supplementary or alternative submission that there is nothing in the Electricity Act, 2003 to restore to any party the right to sue for a cause which has already become barred by law of Limitation, rather under the mandate of Section 175 of the Electricity Act, the Limitation Act has to be given full respect as a law for the time being in force unless any provision of the Limitation Act is found to be inconsistent with the Electricity Act. Only in a situation of conflict, the electricity Act will have a superior or overriding force by virtue of Section 174 of the Electricity Act.\\n15. Yet another submission of Mr. Giri is that the matter does not attract Section 2(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for brevity \\'Arbitration Act\\') rather Section 43 of the Arbitration Act shall govern the rights of the parties and it mandates that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in courts. It may however be noted here that in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) in para 65, the Court held that the Limitation Act would not be applicable in such matters for various reasons including Section 2(4) of the Arbitration Act which was extracted to highlight that Sub-section (1) of Section 40, Sections 41 and 43 all in Part I of the Arbitration Act, would not apply to arbitration under any other enactment. Only rest of the Limitation Act would be applicable to the extent not inconsistent with the other enactment or any Rule made thereunder. On that basis in Paragraph 66 it was held that the provisions with regard to Limitation Act Under Section 43 of the Arbitration Act would not be applicable to statutory-arbitrations conducted under the Electricity Act, 2003.\\n16. In fairness to the submission of Mr. Giri, it is noted that in the PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra), in Paragraphs 64 and 68, this Court was satisfied on facts itself that the principle of delay and laches was not attracted. Further, the provisions in the PPA in that case provided that the seat of Arbitration shall be in London and that alone made part I of the Arbitration Act inapplicable to the arbitration proceeding and ruled out applicability of Section 43 also.\\n17. Mr. Giri has placed considerable reliance upon a judgment by three Judges of this Court in \\nState of Kerala and Ors Vs. V.R. Kalliyanikutty and Anr, \\n. The question of law in that case was whether a debt which is barred by the law of limitation can be recovered by resorting to recovery proceedings under the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act of 1968. The High Court held that in the absence of any provision in the aforesaid Kerala Act creating a substantive right to recover time barred debts, such debts could not be recovered through the summary proceedings under that Act. As per Section 71 of the Kerala Act the Government could issue a notification making the provisions of the Act applicable to the recovery of \"amounts due\" from any person or class of persons to any specified institution or any class of institutions. The say of State Government and the State Financial Corporation was that the words \"amounts due\" will encompass time barred claims also. This Court placed reliance upon judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Hansraj Gupta and Others vs. Official Liquidators of The DehraAIR 1933 63 (Privy Council) . It found that the Kerala Act did not create any new right rather it only provided a process for speedy recovery of moneys due. Therefore the person claiming recovery cannot claim amounts which arc not legally recoverable nor can a defence of limitation available to a debtor in a suit or other legal proceeding be taken away under the provisions of the Kerala Act. The State supported its stand by highlighting the settled legal principle that the statute of limitation merely bars the remedy without touching the right. But such submission did not cut any ice. Relevant provisions of the Kerala Act led to a conclusion that although the necessity of filing a suit stood avoided, the claim which could be legally recovered was not enlarged. In para 16 this Court concluded thus:\\n......... An Act must expressly provide for such enlargement of claims which arc legally recoverable, before it can be interpreted as extending to the recovery of those amounts which have ceased to be legally recoverable on the date when recovery proceedings arc undertaken......\\nIn fact this Court looked to the scheme of the Kerala Act to come to a conclusion that \"amounts due\" are those amounts which the creditor could have recovered had he filed a suit.\\n18. It is noteworthy that besides drawing relevant inference from the provisions of the Kerala Act, in paragraph 11 the Court acted cautiously in interpreting the words \"amounts due\" in view of Article 14 of the Constitution. It expressed its views thus:\\n..... Moreover, such a wide interpretation of \"amounts due\" which destroys an important defence available to a debtor in a suit against him by the creditor, may attract Article 14 against the Act. It would be ironic if an Act for speedy recovery is held as enabling a creditor who has delayed recovery beyond the period of limitation to recover such delayed claims.\\nIn para 12 the Court referred to and relied upon judgment in the case of \\nNew Delhi Municipal Committee Vs. Kalu Ram and Another, \\nwherein this Court had similarly interpreted Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1958. The words \"arrears of rent payable\" were given a limited meaning by holding thus:\\n..... In the context of recovery of arrears of rent Under Section 7, this Court said that if the recovery is barred by the law of limitation, it is difficult to hold that the Estate Officer could still insist that the said amount was payable. When a duty is cast on an authority to determine the arrears of rent the determination must be in accordance with law.....\\n(emphasis added)\\n19. Mr. Giri referred to paragraphs 98 and 99 of the judgment in the case of \\nKihoto Hollohan Vs. Zachillhu and Others, \\nto highlight the attributes of a \"Court\" and those of a Tribunal and also the relevant tests which led the court to hold that the Speaker while deciding certain disputes is a Tribunal. Similarly in the case of \\nThakur Jugal Kishore Sinha Vs. Sitamarhi Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. and Another, \\n, this Court held that the Assistant Registrar of Co-operative Societies was a court within the meaning of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. This inference was based on the pronounced view that the subordination for the purpose of Section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act means judicial subordination under the constitutional provisions and not subordination under the usual hierarchy of courts as per Code of Civil Procedure or the Code of Criminal Procedure. The next case in this series is that of \\nBrajnandan Sinha Vs. Jyoti Narain, \\n. In this case it was found that the Commissioner appointed under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act 1850 (Act 37 of 1850) is not a court within the meaning of the term Under Section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act. This view found favour largely because the Commissioner did not have the legal capacity under that Act to deliver \"definitive judgment\". Mr. Giri has however sought to highlight paragraphs 14 to 18 of the judgment which deal with the essential attributes of a Tribunal so as to clothe it with the status of a court. Those paragraphs are as follows:\\n(14) The pronouncement of a definitive judgment is thus considered the essential \\'sine qua non\\' of a Court and unless and until a binding and authoritative judgment can be pronounced by a person or body of persons it cannot be predicated that he or they constitute a Court.\\n(15) The Privy Council in the case of \\'Shell Co. of Australia v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation\\', 1931 AC 275 (A) thus defined \\'Judicial Power\\' at p. 295:\\n\\'Is this right? What is \\'Judicial power\\'? Their Lordships are of opinion that one of the best definitions is that given by Griffith C.J. in -\\'Huddart, Parker & Co. v. Moorehead\\', (1909) 8 CLR 330 at p. 357(B) where he says: \\'I am of opinion that the words \\'judicial power\\' as used in S. 71 of the Constitution mean the power which every sovereign authority must of necessity have to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property. The exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action\\'.\\nTheir Lordships further enumerated at p. 297 certain negative propositions in relation to this subject:\\n\\'1. A tribunal is not necessarily a Court in this strict sense because it gives a final decision;\\n2. Nor because it hears witnesses on oath;\\n3. Nor because two or more contending parties appear before it between whom it has to decide;\\n4. Nor because it gives decisions which affect the rights of subjects;\\n5. Nor because there is an appeal to a Court;\\n6. Nor because it is a body to which a matter is referred by another body.\\nSee \\'Rex v. Electricity Commissioners\\' 1924-1 KB 171 (C)\\'\\nand observed at page 298:\\n\\'An administrative tribunal may act judicially, but still remain an administrative tribunal as distinguished from a Court, strictly so-called. Mere externals do not make a direction to an administrative officer by an ad hoc tribunal an exercise by a Court of judicial power.\\'\\n(16) The same principle was reiterated by this Court in \\nThe Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi Vs. Employees of the Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi and The Bharat Bank Employees\\' Union, Delhi, \\nand - \\nMaqbool Hussain Vs. The State of Bombay, \\n, where the test of a judicial tribunal as laid down in a passage from - \\'Cooper v. Willson\\', 1937-2 KB 309 (F) at p. 340, was adopted by this Court:\\n\\'A true judicial decision presupposes an existing dispute between two or more parties, and then involves four requisites: - (1) The presentation (not necessarily orally) of their case by the parties to the dispute, (2) if the dispute between them is a question of fact, the ascertainment of the fact by means of evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute and often with the assistance of argument by or on behalf of the parties on the evidence; (3) if the dispute between them is a question of law, the submission of legal arguments by the parties; and (4) a decision which disposes of the whole matter by a finding upon the facts in dispute and an application of the law of the land to the facts so found, including where required a ruling upon any disputed question of law\\'.\\n(17) \\'Maqbool Hussain\\'s case (E)\\', above referred to, was followed by this Court in \\nS.A. Venkataraman Vs. The Union of India (UOI) and Another, \\n, where a Constitution Bench of this Court also laid down that both finality and authoritativeness were the essential tests of a judicial pronouncement.\\n(18) It is clear, therefore, that in order to constitute a Court in the strict sense of the term, an essential condition is that the Court should have, apart from having some of the trappings of a judicial tribunal, power to give a decision or a definitive judgment which has finality and authoritativeness which are the essential tests of a judicial pronouncement.\\n20. On behalf of Appellants reliance was next placed upon case of \\nP. Sarathy Vs. State Bank of India, \\n. A Bench of two Judges considered the scope of the word \"Court\" occurring in Section 14 of the Limitation Act and held that any authority or tribunal having trappings of a court is covered because \"Court\" does not necessarily have to be a civil court. On such reasonings the appellate authority Under Section 41 of Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act was held to be a court. One must notice here only that the judgment in the case of P. Sarathy (supra) has been considered in a recent judgment of this Court rendered by a Bench of two Judges in the case of \\nM.P. Steel Corporation Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise\\n . In this case it was held that although the Limitation Act including Section 14 thereof would not apply to appeals filed before a quasi-judicial tribunal such as the Collector (Appeals) mentioned in Section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962 but the principles underlying Section 14 of the Limitation Act would nevertheless apply as they advance the cause of justice. The Court repelled the submission that Section 128 of the Customs Act excludes the application of the principles underlying Section 14 of the Limitation Act. In order to reach the conclusion that only principles underlying Section 14 and not the very Section itself can apply to tribunals having attributes of Court, in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra) the Court analysed the precedents and the Limitation Act 1963. It concluded that a quasi-judicial Tribunal will suffer Limitation Act only as per the statutory scheme under which it is created and functions. On the other hand, on its own the Limitation Act is applicable in respect of proceedings before courts proper, i.e., courts as understood in the strict sense of being part of the Judicial Branch of the State. In support of this principle several judgments of this Court were noted such as a three-Judge Bench judgment in \\nThe Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P., Lucknow Vs. Parson Tools and Plants, Kanpur, \\nin which reliance was placed upon \\nSmt. Ujjam Bai Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, \\n. For the same purpose reliance was also placed upon judgment in the case of \\nJagannath Prasad Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh, \\n. A contrary view taken by a two-Judge Bench in the case of \\nMukri Gopalan Vs. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker, \\nwas therefore held to be at variance with at least five earlier binding judgments and also at odd with a later judgment in the case of \\nConsolidated Engg. Enterprises Vs. Principal Secy. Irrigation Deptt. and Others, \\n. The latter judgment was considered in detail because the three-Judge Bench examined the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and held that provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act 1963 would be applicable to an application Under Section 34 of the 1996 Act filed before a Civil Court for setting aside an Arbitral Award. This view in Consolidated Engg. (supra) has been further clarified by Ravindran, J. (as he then was) in his separate but concurring judgment, particularly in paragraph 44.\\n21. In an attempt to show that the word \"Court\" has been interpreted differently in context of different statutes, Mr. Giri referred to the case of Trans Mediterranean Airways v. Universal Exports (2011) 10 SCC 316. In paragraphs 44 and onwards a number of precedents were noticed as to the meaning and interpretation of the word \"Court\" and in paragraph 57 it was held that the word \"Court\" in Rule 29 of the Second Schedule of the Carriage by Air Act 1972 has been borrowed from the Warsaw Convention and had not been used in the strict sense as used in the procedural laws of this country. The word \"Court\" was, therefore, held to include the consumer forums. In para 58 it was reiterated that in legislations like the Consumer Protection Act the word \"Court\" cannot be given a strict meaning.\\n22. In reply on this issue, learned senior advocate Mr. Sundaram took a frontal stand that Limitation Act does not apply to a proceeding before the Commission because it is not a court stricto-sensu. For this proposition he relied upon judgments in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) and M.P. Steel Corporation (supra). He however floated a suggestion that even when no period of limitation is applicable for initiating action before the Commission, if this Court finds it necessary and in the interest of justice, then a reasonable period may be indicated by this Court for the aforesaid purpose. He hastened to add that such reasonable period can only be as an illustration and not as a fixed period. According to him, a reasonable illustrative period indicated by the court, in practical application, can vary from case to case as per facts of each case. He also contended that even if a definite limitation period is found to be attracted, in view of law laid down clearly in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra), the principles underling Section 14 will be applicable and the same has been rightly applied by APTEL while rendering the impugned order under appeal.\\n23. Mr. Sundaram referred to PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) and placed reliance upon a solitary sentence at the end of paragraph 64 which reads thus:\\nIn any event, the Limitation Act is inapplicable to proceeding before the State Commission.\\nHe also placed reliance upon paragraph 65 which is as follows:\\n65. The submission of the Appellant that the Limitation Act would be available in case the reference was to be made to arbitration, in our opinion, is also without merit. Firstly, the State Commission exercised its jurisdiction to decide the dispute itself. The matter was not referred to arbitration, therefore, the Limitation Act would not be applicable. Secondly, Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act would not be applicable even if the matter was referred to arbitration by virtue of Section 2(4) of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Section 2(4) of the Arbitration Act reads as under:\\n\\'2(4) This Part except Sub-section (1) of Section 40, Sections 41 and 43 shall apply to every arbitration under any other enactment for the time being in force, as if the arbitration were pursuant to an arbitration agreement and as if that other enactment were an arbitration agreement, except insofar as the provisions of this Part are inconsistent with that other enactment or with any rules made thereunder.\\n24. Mr. Sundaram placed reliance upon judgment in the case of M.P. Steel Corporation (supra) to support his submission that Limitation Act applies only to courts stricto-sensu and not to quasi-judicial tribunals. It may be noted here that the matter in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra) had arisen from proceedings under the Customs Act and hence in that case there was no occasion to consider the issue whether the Limitation Act is applicable to an action initiated before the Commission by virtue of provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. However, this judgment does help the Respondents to an extent by holding that principles underlying Section 14 of the Limitation Act will be applicable even in matters filed before a quasi-judicial tribunal such as the Commission. But the moot question remains to be answered - whether the bar of limitation is required to be respected by the Commission on the ground that there is no provision in the Electricity Act conferring additional rights upon a party moving the Commission for relief so as to claim even such reliefs which stand barred by limitation before the Civil Court or even for arbitral proceedings. The other ancillary issue required to be answered is whether by virtue of provisions of the Electricity Act 2003 the Limitation Act has been made applicable to an action before the Commission by express provision or even by necessary intendment.\\n25. Before answering the aforesaid two issues and then adverting to the question whether principles of Section 14 were rightly applied by APTEL (in case any period of limitation is held to be attracted), it will be proper to note some relevant contentions advanced by learned senior advocate Mr. Jayant Bhushan who has appeared for some of the Respondents.\\n26. Mr. Bhushan pointed out that Commission is a creature of Statute and hence it cannot reject a claim on the ground of limitation unless limitation is found to be applicable by virtue of the provisions of the Electricity Act 2003. According to him if Limitation Act does not apply, courts cannot import limitation and the exceptional cases where this Court has introduced principles of delay and laches relate to proceedings before quasi-judicial tribunals which are vested with discretionary or suo motu jurisdiction like revisional power; the other exception being courts having extraordinary or equity jurisdiction such as writ jurisdiction vested in the High Courts or the Supreme Court. In support of the limited and exceptional applicability of principles of delay and laches as distinguished from limitation, Mr. Bhushan placed reliance upon an old judgment of Supreme Court of United States in the case of Henry Hauenstein v. John A. Lynham 100 U.S. 483 and also upon extracts from Halsbury\\'s Laws of England and a judgment of Chancery Division in the case of Re. Jarvis (Deceased) Edge v. Jarvis (1958) 2 All. ER 336 . Since the principle noted above is well settled, the above authorities need not be discussed particularly when this Court has taken similar view in the case of \\nBombay Gas Co. Ltd. Vs. Gopal Bhiva and Others, \\nand \\nM/s. Hindustan Times Limited Vs. Union of India and Others, \\n. In the latter case the issue under consideration was of delay in passing order levying damages under Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The Court distinguished long line of cases such as \\nThe State of Gujarat Vs. Patil Raghav Natha and Others, \\nand \\nRam Chand and Others Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Others, \\nby pointing out that same principles will not apply to moneys withheld by a defaulter when he actually holds the money in Trust for the beneficiaries. Paragraph 19 of that judgment highlights that the concerned Statute does not contain any provision prescribing a period of limitation either for assessment or recovery and although the moneys payable into the Fund are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but there is no provision by which the employees can directly recover the due amounts. The power of recovery is vested in the statutory authorities to be exercised in the manner provided by the Statute and not by way of suit.\\n27. Mr. Bhushan also referred to some judgments in support of the principle that Statute of limitation only bars a remedy through ordinary suit and not a remedy provided under a special Statute such as the Industrial Disputes Act which must be given effect to on the basis of various provisions contained therein. For this purpose he relied upon a Constitution Bench judgment in the case of \\nBombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Vs. The State of Bombay and Others, \\n. He sought to explain the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of \\nTilokchand and Motichand and Others Vs. H.B. Munshi and Another, \\nby pointing out that delay and laches were held to be applicable to a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for the reason that such jurisdiction was always recognized and held to be a discretionary one.\\n28. Coming back to the issues relating to limitation, in view of law noticed above and for the reasons noted in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra), we respectfully concur and hold that by itself the Limitation Act will not be applicable to the Commission under the Indian Electricity Act 2003 as the Commission is not a Court stricto sensu. Further stand of the Respondents that the Commission being a statutory tribunal, cannot act beyond the four walls of the Electricity Act also does not brook any exception. In the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) this Court examined the issue of limitation in a very summary manner and without referring to the relevant provisions of the Electricity Act 2003, at the end of para 64 it was observed in a single sentence that the Limitation Act is inapplicable to proceeding before the State Commission. But in view of detailed discussion in the case of M.P. Steel Corporation (supra), we have held above that by itself the Limitation Act is inapplicable to proceeding or action brought before the State Commission. However, the Electricity Act 2003 requires a further scrutiny to find out whether by virtue of Section 175 of the Electricity Act or otherwise it can be inferred that the provisions of Limitation Act will govern or curtail the powers of the Commission in entertaining a claim Under Section 86(1)(f) of the Electricity Act. Section 175 reads thus:\\n175. Provisions of this Act to be in addition to and not in derogation of other laws. - The provisions of this Act are in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force.\\nA plain reading of this Section leads to a conclusion that unless the provisions of the Electricity Act are in conflict with any other law when this Act will have overriding effect as per Section 174, the provisions of Electricity Act will not adversely affect any other law for the time being in force. In other words, as stated in the Section the provisions of the Electricity Act will be additional provisions without adversely affecting or substracting anything from any other law which may be in force. Such provision cannot be stretched to infer adoption of the Limitation Act for the purpose of regulating the varied and numerous powers and functions of authorities under Electricity Act 2003. In this context it is relevant to keep in view that the State Commission or the Central Commission have been entrusted with large number of diverse functions, many being administrative or regulatory and such powers do not invite the rigours of the Limitation Act. Only for controlling the quasi judicial functions of the Commission Under Section 86(1)(f), it will not be possible to accept the contention of the Appellant that by Section 175 the Electricity Act, 2003 adopts the Limitation Act either explicitly or by necessary implication.\\n29. The only other weighty contention of Mr. Giri that there is nothing in the Electricity Act 2003 to create a right in a suitor before the Commission to seek claims which are barred by law of limitation merits a serious consideration. There is no possibility of any difference of opinion in accepting that on account of judgment of this Court in Gujarat Urja (supra) the Commission has been elevated to the status of a substitute for the Civil Court in respect of all disputes between the licencees and generating companies. Such dispute need not arise from the exercise of powers under the Electricity Act. Even claims or disputes arising purely out of contract like in the present case have to be either adjudicated by the Commission or the Commission itself has the discretion to refer the dispute for arbitration after exercising its power to nominate the arbitrator. It is in view of such far reaching judicial powers vested in the Commission that in the case of PPN Power Generating Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) this Court advised the State to exercise enabling power Under Section 84(2) to appoint a person who is/has been a Judge of a High Court as Chairperson of the State Commission. In such a situation it falls for consideration whether the principle of law enunciated in State of Kerala v. V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) and in the case of New Delhi Municipal Committee v. Kalu Ram (supra) is attracted so as to bar entertainment of claims which are legally not recoverable in a suit or other legal proceeding on account of bar created by the Limitation Act. On behalf of Respondents those judgments were explained by pointing out that in the first case the peculiar words in the statute - \"amount due\" and in the second case \"arrears of rent payable\" fell for interpretation in the context of powers of concerned tribunal and on account of aforesaid particular words of the statute this Court held that the duty cast upon the authority to determine what is recoverable or payable implies a duty to determine such claims in accordance with law. In our considered view a statutory authority like the Commission is also required to determine or decide a claim or dispute either by itself or by referring it to arbitration only in accordance with law and thus Section 174 and 175 of the Electricity Act assume relevance. Since no separate limitation has been prescribed for exercise of power Under Section 86(1)(f) nor this adjudicatory power of the Commission has been enlarged to entertain even the time barred claims, there is no conflict between the provisions of the Electricity Act and Limitation Act to attract the provisions of Section 174 of the Electricity Act. In such a situation on account of provisions in Section 175 of the Electricity Act or even otherwise the power of adjudication and determination or even the power of deciding whether a case requires reference to arbitration must be exercised in a fair manner and in accordance with law. In the absence of any provision in the Electricity Act creating a new right upon a claimant to claim even monies barred by law of limitation, or taking away a right of the other side to take a lawful defence of limitation, we are persuaded to hold that in the light of nature of judicial power conferred on the Commission, claims coming for adjudication before it cannot be entertained or allowed if it is found legally not recoverable in a regular suit or any other regular proceeding such as arbitration, on account of law of limitation. We have taken this view not only because it appears to be more just but also because unlike Labour laws and Industrial Disputes Act, the Electricity Act has no peculiar philosophy or inherent underlying reasons requiring adherence to a contrary view.\\n30. We have taken the aforesaid view to avoid injustice as well as possibility of discrimination. We have already extracted a part of paragraph 11 of the judgment in the case of State of Kerala v. V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) wherein Court considered the matter also in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution. In that case the possibility of Article 14 being attracted against the statute was highlighted to justify a particular interpretation as already noted. It was also observed that it would be ironic if in the name of speedy recovery contemplated by the statute, a creditor is enabled to recover claims beyond the period of limitation. In this context, it would be fair to infer that the special adjudicatory role envisaged Under Section 86(1)(f) also appears to be for speedy resolution so that a vital developmental factor - electricity and its supply is not adversely affected by delay in adjudication of even ordinary civil disputes by the Civil Court. Evidently, in absence of any reason or justification the legislature did not contemplate to enable a creditor who has allowed the period of limitation to set in, to recover such delayed claims through the Commission. Hence we hold that a claim coming before the Commission cannot be entertained or allowed if it is barred by limitation prescribed for an ordinary suit before the civil court. But in appropriate case, a specified period may be excluded on account of principle underlying salutary provisions like Section 5 or 14 of the Limitation Act. We must hasten to add here that such limitation upon the Commission on account of this decision would be only in respect of its judicial power under Clause (f) of subsection (1) of Section 86 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and not in respect of its other powers or functions which may be administrative or regulatory.\\n31. In the light of above there can be no difficulty in appreciating that M/s. LANCO rightly appreciated the hurdle of limitation in its way when such an objection was taken by the Appellant and it rightly chose to seek exclusion of the period it was pursuing arbitration proceeding before the High Court, on the basis of principles underlying Section 14 of the Limitation Act.\\n32. The issue as to whether the impugned order by APTEL permitting application of principles on Section 14 of the Limitation Act is in accordance with law or warrants interference now requires to be answered on the basis of law as well as facts. In law, the APTEL could grant exclusion of certain period on the basis of principles Under Section 14 in view of law laid down or clarified in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra). On facts, although the parties have argued at length, we find no difficulty in holding that APTEL has adopted a just and lawful approach in examining the relevant facts and in excluding the entire period claimed by M/s. LANCO which starts from the notice for arbitration dated 8.9.2003 given by M/s. LANCO, till the application of M/s. LANCO Under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act before the High Court was finally disposed of on 18.3.2009. The issue whether the first notice dated 8.9.2003 or the next notice dated 26.3.2004 should be treated as notice for arbitration for the purpose of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act was rightly not pursued further by Mr. Giri after some initial arguments. But since this issue was touched, we have looked at the entire Article 14 of the PPA as well as the notice dated 8.9.2003 and we find no difficulty in holding it as the notice for arbitration which amounted to initiation of arbitral proceedings as contemplated by Section 21 of the Arbitration Act. A spirited argument was advanced on behalf of Appellant that after the judgment of this Court in Gujarat Urja (supra) on 13.3.2008, the continuance of the arbitral proceedings before the High Court at the instance of M/s. LANCO should not be accepted as bona fide and that the commission was justified in not excluding this period of about one year on the ground that it was not bona fide and in such facts APTEL should not have taken a contrary view. Having considered submissions of the parties we find no merit in the aforesaid contention advanced on behalf of Appellant. The view which we are going to take has been indicated by this Court in several judgments including M.P. Steel Corporation (supra). But the point requires no debate in view of clear stipulation in explanation (a) to Sub-section (3) of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. This explanation reads as follows:\\nExplanation - For the purposes of this section,-\\n(a) in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding was pending, the day on which that proceeding was instituted and the day on which it ended shall both be counted...........\\nThe same conclusion is inevitable even on other relevant facts. The Appellant had notice of the arbitral proceeding and after judgment in Gujarat Urja (supra), the Appellant also took no steps to get the application Under Section 11 listed and disposed of earlier to 18.3.2009. The averments and the materials are not sufficient to establish the claim of the Appellant that the proceeding ceased to be bona fide after 13.3.2008. As a consequence of aforesaid discussion, the challenge to impugned order in respect of views taken on the issue of limitation in the light of principles of Section 14 of the Limitation Act fails.\\nIssues relating to MAT\\n33. The notice of Arbitration dated 8.9.2003, inter alia, made a demand for reimbursement of income tax payment made by M/s. LANCO, as per Article 3.8 of the PPA. No doubt the claim on this head for the subsequent years was not and could not be in this notice but the difference between the parties on the issue had already arisen. In the notice claims for advance income tax for the period 1.4.2001 to 15.6.2003 amounting to Rs. 13.14 crores were included under the heading \"General Nature of Claims\" and under the heading \"Relief Sought\", M/s. LANCO claimed - \"a declaration that the claimant is entitled to reimbursement of advance income tax paid by the claimant\". Under the same heading M/s. LANCO mentioned that it reserves its rights to seek such other reliefs or amend/supplement the reliefs in the Statement of Claim as it may deem appropriate whenever the same is filed before the Arbitral Tribunal. Thus the issue whether MAT is covered by Article 3.8 of the PPA was clearly covered by Arbitration notice. The filing of upto date claims through amendment or otherwise before the Arbitral Tribunal could not happen for the obvious reason that application Under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act itself remained pending till 18th March, 2009 before the High Court and thereafter before the Commission.\\n34. It has already been noted that the claim for reimbursement of MAT for the period 2001-2005 was rejected by the Commission on the ground of limitation and after impugned order by APTEL reversing such order, that claim stands remitted to the Commission for passing a consequential order. The claims for other periods have been allowed by the Commission. On account of our view indicated earlier upholding the order of APTEL on the issue of limitation, the claim of MAT for 2001-2005 cannot be treated as barred by limitation. Thus the claim of MAT for entire concerned period that is from 2001-2012 will be covered by our decision on Merits of Claim relating to MAT. The argument of Mr. Giri that MAT cannot be covered by the provisions in Article 3.8 of the PPA providing for claims for taxes on income because the Appellant had not foreseen such eventuality in view of the then prevailing tax regime under which income from such power projects stood exempted, is noticed only to be rejected. The entire phraseology used in Article 3.8 of the PPA leaves no manner of doubt that parties were aware that tax regime keeps changing and therefore any advance income tax payable for the income from the project only had to be reimbursed by the Board. As a successor of the Board the Appellant cannot avoid the liability to reimburse advance income tax paid by the M/s. LANCO, on the ground that MAT was a new variety of tax concept introduced subsequently in which minimum tax became payable on the basis of mere book profits of even power generating companies. The argument that such tax is not on income from the project and therefore, not covered by Article 3.8 of the PPA is also found to be without any substance.\\n35. The objective of levying MAT, as declared by the Income Tax Department is to bring into the tax net \"Zero Tax Companies\" which inspite of having earned substantial book profits and having paid handsome dividends, do not pay any tax due to various tax concessions and incentives provided under the Income Tax Law. It is no body\\'s case that in fact M/s. LANCO had not generated income from the project during the relevant years. The taxable income, of course, became amenable to MAT on account of Section 115JB. The Legislative changes in respect of MAT show that it came into force initially with effect from 1.4.1988 by introduction of Section 115J in the Income Tax Act, 1961 but this provision was amended to exempt power generating companies with effect from 1.4.1989 and from 1.4.1991 MAT became inapplicable because of deletion of Section 115J which was reintroduced with effect from 1.4.1997 by insertion of Section 115JA. But it was not made applicable to power generating companies till 31.3.2001. However, Section 115JA was withdrawn and Section 115JB was inserted with effect from 1.4.2001 to make MAT applicable to all targeted corporate entities including power generating companies. The submission on behalf of the Appellant that Section 115JB is a tax not on profit but of different character is based on misconception. No doubt this Section has a special provision for payment of tax by certain companies on the basis of its book profit which is deemed to be the total income of the Assessee and is subjected to income tax at a specified rate. The provisions of Sections 115JA and 115JB have been also construed as a self-contained code in \\nAjanta Pharma Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax-9, Mumbai, \\nand in several other judgments as stand alone sections. But that does not change the basic nature of the provision. It remains a provision under the Income Tax Act and what is levied is income tax on the assessment of income as per such a special provision.\\n36. Article 1.4 of the PPA provides inter alia that reference to any \\'Law\\' shall be construed as a reference to such Law as from time to time amended or re-enacted. This general provision in our view is sufficient to take care of all the taxes on income under Article 3.8 of the PPA notwithstanding different rates of income tax or other changes which may be brought about in the Income Tax Act. This view commends itself to us because such change in Law relating to Income Tax does not require any additional claim to be raised by the power generating companies. There is no specific amount - or rate which is to be reimbursed by the Board. Rather, the entire advance income tax payable requires reimbursement on account of Article 3.8 of the PPA provided of course that the accounts are maintained in the manner required by the Agreement so that tax is only on the basis of income from the project. No such dispute has been raised in the present case.\\n37. The claim of the Appellant that liability of MAT is on account of change in Law and therefore required M/s. LANCO to adopt the procedure for making claims under Article 11.4 of the PPA does not appeal to us for the aforesaid reasons. The entire stipulation in Article 11.4 of the PPA is in respect of additional or reduced expenditures or costs which have not been catered for and arise later due to change in Law. The burden on account of income tax as per Article 3.9 of the PPA cannot be treated as additional or reduced burden because the entire actual advance income tax payable for the project is required to be reimbursed by the Board. It is immaterial whether the income tax payable is high or low in any particular year. When there is already a special provision in respect of entire payable taxes on income under Article 3.8 of the PPA, that should have precedence over the general provisions in Article 11.4 of the PPA.\\n38. We have also considered other relevant provisions of the Income Tax such as definition of income, total income, tax and find that they do not help the case of the Appellant in any manner. Section 2(43) defines \\'Tax\\' to mean income tax chargeable under the provisions of Income Tax Act and \\'Total Income\\' has been defined with reference to Section 5 which enlarges the scope of total income not only to income received or accrued but also deemed to be received or deemed to be accrued in India (for a resident). Simply because the exemption earlier granted to power generating companies has been withdrawn so as to subject them to income tax liability under a special provision, cannot lead to any inference as suggested on behalf of the Appellant that it is not an income tax but some other tax which is levied Under Section 115JB of the Income Tax Act. Hence we hold the claim for MAT covered by Article 3.8 of the PPA and payable as such when requisite conditions stand satisfied.\\n39. In the final conclusion, we find no scope to interfere with the impugned order in these appeals. The appeals are dismissed but without any order as to costs.\\n'),\n",

Contact immediately with certificates. Mahatma Gandhi Vidyamandir, Bandra (E), Mumbai-51.\\n3. It is apparent that the Appellant-society was looking out for a Trained Graduate Teacher to teach English and Sanskrit. It also emerges from the advertisement, that the choice for appointment was to be made from out of backward class candidates, if possible. The Respondent-R.T. Bhitale, who belonged to the category of \\'Other Backward Class\\' which is also amongst the backward classes, recognized for the present process of appointment, applied for the post of Trained Graduate Teacher, in furtherance of the advertisement extracted above. He was selected, and was issued the following appointment order on 07.12.1987:\\nWith reference to your application dated 4.4.1987, I have the pleasure to inform you that you are hereby appointed as an Asstt. Teacher on Rs. 365/- per month in the scale of Rs. 365-15-500-20-660-EB-20-760 with effect from 7.12.1987 or the date you report for duty. You will be entitled to allowance such as compensatory local allowances, House Rent Allowance and dearness allowance as specifically sanctioned by Government from time to time.\\n2. Your appointment is purely temporary for a period of (not legible) months from 7.12.1987 to 30.4.1988 (not legible). After expiry of the above period your services shall stand terminated without any notice or (not legible).\\n3. The terms of your employment and conditions of service shall be as laid down in the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 and the rules made thereunder.\\n4. You shall have to undergo a medical examination by Dr. (not legible) within three months from the date of joining the post. Your appointment shall be conditional pending the receipt of physical fitness certificate from the doctor whose name is mentioned above.\\n(Emphasis is ours)\\n\\n4. It is therefore apparent, that the Respondent\\'s appointment, was for the remaining period of the academic session 1987-88, and would culminate on 30.04.1988. The School Management Committee took a decision on 29.03.1988, not to continue with the Respondent any further, and accordingly, in consonance with the letter of appointment dated 07.12.1987, his appointment came to an end on 30.04.1988. He was intimated about his termination on the same day i.e., on 30.03.1988.\\n5. Dissatisfied with the order, by which his services were dispensed with, the Respondent preferred an appeal assailing the order dated 30.04.1988 Under Section 9 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as \\'the 1977 Act\\'). The position adopted by the Respondent was, that his appointment vide order dated 07.12.1987 was liable to be considered as permanent, since the same was against a permanent vacancy, created by the resignation of Raut. It was also his contention, that he belonged to the reserved category, for which the post had been advertised, and as such, there was no justification whatsoever for not treating his appointment as permanent.\\n6. The above position adopted by the Respondent, was sought to be contested by the Appellant-society. The case set up by the Appellant-society was, that the Respondent did not satisfy the conditions of eligibility, for occupying the vacancy created by Raut. In this behalf even while acknowledging the position adopted by the Respondent, namely, that the post in question was to be filled up by way of reservation out of backward classes candidates, it was pointed out, that those who had responded to the advertisement dated 04.12.1987, should have had qualifications which would enable them to teach the subjects of English and Sanskrit, namely, the subjects which Raut was handling, while in the employment of the Mahatma Gandhi Vidyamandir School. It was also the case of the Appellant-society, that whilst the Respondent possessed the qualifications to teach English, he did not possess the qualifications to teach Sanskrit, and without possessing the said qualifications, he would be useless for imparting training in the subject of Sanskrit. To substantiate, that the Respondent did not possess any qualification in Sanskrit, the Appellant-society has placed on the record of this case, a xerox copy of the B.A. (Special) degree qualification, as also, the B. Ed degree qualification awarded to the Respondent, wherefrom it is apparent, that he did not undertake any course in the subject of Sanskrit. The fact that the Respondent did not possess any qualification in the subject of Sanskrit, is not a matter of dispute, between the rival parties.\\n7. The School Tribunal accepted the appeal preferred by the Respondent, vide an order dated 26.06.1992. The School Tribunal arrived at the conclusion, that the appointment of the Respondent was liable to be treated as permanent, and as such, since the services of the Respondent had been terminated in violation of the statutory rules, his termination from employment, was held as not sustainable in law.\\n8. The order dated 26.06.1992 passed by the School Tribunal was assailed by the Appellant-society before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (hereinafter referred to as \\'the High Court\\') by filing Writ Petition No. 232 of 1993. During the hearing of the aforesaid writ petition, the High Court passed an interim order dated 05.03.1993. The interim order passed by the High Court is available on the record of this case. Its perusal reveals, that as an interim measure, the High Court required the Appellant-society to engage the Respondent herein, on a year to year basis, without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the rival parties. It is also not a matter of dispute, that in furtherance of the interim order dated 05.03.1993, the Respondent was continued in the employment of the Appellant-society, on a year to year basis.\\n9. After having been reinstated in service in terms of the order passed by the School Tribunal dated 26.06.1992, and the interim order passed by the High Court on 05.03.1993, the Respondent desired to contest elections in January, 1995. He sought leave for the above purpose. The request of the Respondent, for leave made through his representation dated 19.01.1995, was declined by the Appellant-society on 31.1.1995. The Appellant-society advised the Respondent to tender his resignation, if he desired to contest the above election, Under Rule 42(3) of the Maharashtra Private School Employees (Condition of Service) Rules, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as \\'the \\'1981 Rules\\'). Despite the fact, that the Respondent was denied leave for the period in terms of his representation dated 19.01.1995, the Respondent did not attend to his duties, and any how contested the above election. He also did not tender his resignation in terms of Rule 42(3) of the 1981 Rules. It is therefore, that the Appellant-society yet again terminated the services of the Respondent, by an order dated 16.02.1995.\\n10. The above order of termination dated 16.02.1995 was again assailed by the Respondent, by preferring an appeal before the School Tribunal, Under Section 9 of the 1977 Act. On 09.03.1995, the School Tribunal passed an interim order in favour of the Respondent, by which the impugned order of termination dated 16.02.1995 was ordered to be stayed. It is in the above circumstances, that the Respondent once again despite his termination for the second time, was permitted to continue in service.\\n11. The above appeal filed by the Respondent, to assail the order dated 16.02.1995, was dismissed in default on 30.04.2001. A request made by the Respondent for restoration of the same, was declined by the School Tribunal on 10.02.2003. It is in the above circumstances, that the Respondent preferred Writ Petition No. 2975 of 2003 before the High Court. By an order dated 01.12.2003, the High Court allowed the above writ petition, and ordered the restoration of the appeal preferred by the Respondent, before the School Tribunal. By its order dated 07.05.2004, the School Tribunal dismissed the appeal filed by the Respondent, against the order of his termination dated 16.02.1995. On this occasion, the Respondent approached the High Court by filing Writ Petition No. 10576 of 2004.\\n12. By the impugned order dated 28.10.2005, the High Court collectively disposed of Writ Petition No. 232 of 1993 filed by the Appellant-society, and Writ Petition No. 10576 of 2004 preferred by the Respondent. The High Court affirmed the order passed by the School Tribunal dated 26.06.1992 holding, that the Appellant was inducted as a permanent employee, and his services were dispensed with in violation of the statutory rules. Insofar as Writ Petition 10576 of 2004 is concerned, the High Court arrived at the conclusion, that the School Management was not justified in requiring the Respondent to tender his resignation Under Rule 42(3) of the 1981 Rules, on account of the fact that he was a permanent employee, and not a temporary employee.\\n13. The instant controversy, necessarily has to be examined in the background of the statutory rules relied on. First and foremost, it is essential for us to take into consideration Section 5 of the 1977 Act. The same is being extracted hereunder:\\n5. Certain obligations of Management of private schools: (1) The Management shall, as soon as possible, fill in, in the manner prescribed, every permanent vacancy in a private school by the appointment of a person duly qualified to fill such vacancy:\\nProvided that, unless such vacancy is to be filled in by promotion, the Management shall, before proceeding to fill such vacancy, ascertain from the Educational Inspector, Greater Bombay, the Education Officer, Zilla Parishad or, as the case may be, the Director or the Officer designated by the Director in respect of schools imparting technical, vocational, art or special education, whether there is any suitable person available on the list of surplus persons maintained by him, for absorption in other schools; and in the event of such person being available, the Management shall appoint that person in such vacancy.\\n(2) Every person appointed to fill a permanent vacancy except Shikshan Sevak shall be on probation for a period of two years. Subject to the provisions of Sub-sections (3) and (4), he shall, on completion of this probation period of two years, be deemed to have been confirmed.\\nProvided that, every person appointed as shikshan sevak shall be on probation for a period of three years.\\n(2A) Subject to the provisions of Sub-sections (3) and (4), Shikshan Sevak shall, on completion of the probation period of three years, be deemed to have been appointed and confirmed as a teacher.\\n(3) If in the opinion of the Management, the work or behaviour of any probationer, during the period of his probation, is not satisfactory, the Management may terminate his services at any time during the said period after giving him one month\\'s notice or salary or honorarium of one month in lieu of notice.\\n(4) If the services of any probationer are terminated Under Sub-section (3) and he is reappointed by the Management in the same school or any other school belonging to it within a period of one year from the date on which his services were terminated, then the period of probation undergone by him previously shall be taken into consideration in calculating the required period of probation for the purposes of Sub-section (2).\\n(4A) Nothing in Sub-section (2), (3) or (4) shall apply to a person appointed to fill a permanent vacancy by promotion or by absorption as provided under the proviso to Sub-section (1).\\n(5) The Management may fill in every temporary vacancy by appointing a person duly qualified to fill such vacancy. The order of appointment shall be drawn up in the form prescribed in that behalf, and shall state the period of appointment of such person.\\n(Emphasis is ours)\\n\\n14. It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent, that Section 5 of the 1977 Act envisages two water tight compartments. The first postulated through Section 5(1) which caters to appointment against permanent vacancies, and Section 5(5) caters to the second contingency, which relates to employment against temporary vacancies. In view of the above, the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned Counsel for the Respondent seems to be justified and we endorse the same, namely, that Section 5 deals with filling up of permanent as well as temporary vacancies. It is however important to highlight, that irrespective of the nature of appointment (against a permanent or temporary vacancy), both the Sub-sections of Section 5, mandate that the appointee will have to be \"... a person duly qualified...\"\\n15. The other statutory provision, that needs to be taken into consideration is Rule 9, of the 1981 Rules. A relevant extract of the same is being extracted hereunder:\\n9. Appointment of staff.\\n(1) The teaching staff of the school shall be adequate having regard to the number of classes in the school and the curriculum including alternative courses provided and the optional subjects taught therein.\\n(2) Appointments of teaching staff (other than the Head and Assistant Head) and those of non-teaching staff in a school shall be made by the School Committee:\\nProvided that, appointments in leave vacancies of a short duration not exceeding three months, may be made by the Head, if so authorized by the School Committee.\\n(3) Unless otherwise provided in these rules for every appointment to be made in a school, for a teaching or a non-teaching post, the candidates eligible for appointment and desirous of applying for such post shall made an application in writing giving full details regarding name, address, date of birth, educational and professional qualifications, experience, etc, attaching true copies of the original certificates. It shall not be necessary for candidates other than those belonging to the various sections of backward communities for whom posts are reserved Under Sub-rule (7) to state their castes in their applications.\\n(4) xxx\\n(5) xxx\\n(6) xxx\\n+ [(7) The Management shall reserve 52 per cent of the total number of posts of the teaching and non-teaching staff for the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Denotified Tribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Special Backward category and other Backward Classes as follows, namely:\\n+ Sub--rule (7) substituted by Not. No. PRASHANYA.. 1005/(94/05)/SE-2 dated 08.07.2008.\\n(8) For the purpose of filling up the vacancies reserved Under Sub-rule (7) the Management shall advertise the vacancies in at least one newspaper having wide circulation in the region and also notify the vacancies to the Employment Exchange of the District and to the District Social Welfare Officer +[and to the associations or organizations of persons belonging to Backward Classes, by whatever names such associations or organizations are called, and which are recognized by Government for the purposes of this sub-rule] requisitioning the names of qualified personnel, if any, registered with them. If it is not possible to fill in the reserved post from amongst candidates, if any, who have applied in response to the advertisement or whose names are recommended by the Employment Exchange or the District Social Welfare Officer +[or such associations or organizations as aforesaid] or if no such names are recommended by the Employment Exchange or the District Social Welfare Officer +[or such associations or organization as aforesaid] within a period of one month the Management may proceed to fill up the reserved post in accordance with the provisions of Sub-rule (9).\\n+ The words are inserted by Not No. PST/1083/194/SE-3-Cell, dated 20.12.1984.\\n(9) (a) In case it is not possible to fill in the teaching post for which a vacancy is reserved for a person belonging to a particular category of Backward Classes, the post may be filled in by selecting a candidate from the other remaining categories in the order specified in Sub-rule (7) and if no person from any of the categories is available, the post may be filled in temporarily or an year-to-year basis by a candidate not belonging to the Backward Classes.\\n(Emphasis is ours)\\n\\n16. It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent, that Under Rule 9, which caters to appointment of teaching staff, the Respondent was liable to be appointed on a permanent post, because his appointment was against a permanent vacancy, created by Raut. It was also his contention, that he belonged to the category of backward classes (contemplated Under Rule 9(7) of the 1981 Rules). It was submitted, that even though the vacancy in question was earmarked for scheduled castes, the Respondent was entitled to be permanently appointed against the same, because of the absence of a suitable and eligible Scheduled Caste candidate or even from the other categories of backward classes, in terms of Rule 9(8) of the 1981 Rules (extracted above). Since the Respondent was selected against a permanent vacancy, which had been duly advertised, as also, against a post reserved for backward classes, his appointment was liable to be considered to be permanent, for all intents and purposes, and specially in terms of the mandate contained in Rule 9(9)(a).\\n17. To counter the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned Counsel for the Respondent, learned Counsel for the Appellants, has invited our attention to Section 5(1), extracted above, in order to contend, that it was imperative for the management to fill up all permanent vacancies, and that, a permanent vacancy should not be left unfilled on account of the adverse affect which was liable to be caused to the students, enrolled in the school run by the Appellant-society. Referring to Section 5(1), it was further submitted, that the selected candidate had to be \"...a person duly qualified to fill such vacancy...\". In addition to the above, it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellants, that in the process of selection, the Appellant-society required a Trained Graduate Teacher, possessing qualifications to teach the subjects of English and Sanskrit. However, in response to the advertisement dated 04.12.1987, the Appellant-society did not find any suitable candidate possessing the above qualifications. It is in the above view of the matter, that the Appellant-society selected the Respondent, and issued an offer of appointment on temporary basis, till the end of the academic session i.e., 30.04.1988. The question that arises for our consideration is, whether the Respondent was liable to be treated as a permanent employee, or whether it was open to the Appellant-society, to appoint him on temporary basis upto 30.04.1988?\\n18. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the issue in hand, we are satisfied, that the effort at the hands of the Appellant-society, in the first instance, ought to have been to fill up the permanent vacancy created by Raut, on permanent basis. This mandate clearly emerges from Section 5(1) of the 1977 Act and Rule 9(9)(a) of the 1981 Rules. However, in case a candidate from the backward class was not available, it was open to the Appellant-society to fill up the post temporarily, on a year to year basis by a candidate who may not belong to the backward classes. It was however the emphatic submission of the learned Counsel for the Respondent, that in case of absence of a candidate belonging to the backward class, the only option available to the Appellant-society was to fill up the vacancy by appointing a candidate \"...not belonging to the backward class\". It was submitted, that the Appellant-society had no option, but to follow the said procedure, in case it desired to fill up the vacancy created by Raut, on temporary basis.\\n19. In our considered view, it is apparent, that the Respondent did not fulfill the desired qualifications for occupying the permanent vacancy created by Raut, inasmuch as, he did not possess the educational qualification of Sanskrit. On account of his not possessing the qualification of Sanskrit, the Respondent was clearly not eligible for filling up the vacancy created by Raut, on a permanent basis.\\n20. The next question that arises for our consideration is, whether the aforesaid vacancy could be filled up on a temporary basis, by a candidate belonging to the backward class? In our view, the answer to the above has to be in the affirmative. We say so because, while filling up the vacancy if a suitable candidate was not available from the particular backward class (for which it was earmarked, in the present case-Scheduled Caste), it was open to the Appellant-society to fill up the vacancy, out of the candidates belonging to other backward classes. And if a suitable candidate belonging to the other backward classes was also not available, then as submitted by the learned Counsel for the Respondent, the vacancy could be filled up temporarily, or on a year to year basis, by a suitable candidate from the general/open category. But, how would the post be filled up if none of the candidates who had applied, is considered suitable, on account of lack of the required qualifications. In such a situation, it must be kept in mind, that if out of the candidates who had applied for the advertised post, a backward class candidate though not fulfilling the qualifications stipulated for the post, was found to be the most meritorious, he could be appointed against the advertised vacancy on temporary basis, Under Rule 9(9)(a) of the 1981 Rules. The Respondent was found to be most meritorious candidate, out of those who had responded to the advertisement dated 04.12.1987. But since he did not possess the qualifications stipulated for the advertised vacancy, it was well within the right of the Appellant-society, to offer him a temporary appointment till the end of the academic year, Under Rule 9(9)(a). Under Rule 9(9)(a), candidates can only be appointed on temporary basis, or on a year to year basis, when none of the backward class candidates is found suitable. Accordingly, when the Respondent was appointed temporarily on 07.12.1987 (upto 30.04.1988) his appointment was in conformity and in consonance with Rule 9(9)(a) of the 1981 Rules.\\n21. In view of the above, we are satisfied that the order of termination of the Respondent\\'s services on 30.04.1988, was not only in consonance with his appointment order dated 07.12.1987, but was also in conformity with the statutory rules.\\n22. Having recorded our above conclusion, it is not necessary for us to deal with the second issue canvassed before us. Be that as it may, we feel compelled to deal with the said issue also, on account of the fact, that detailed submissions were advanced on the said issue also. To determine the validity of the second order of termination dated 16.02.1995, Rule 42 of the 1981 Rules is relevant. The same is extracted hereunder:\\n42. Contesting Elections: (1) Subject to the provisions of Sub-rules (3) to (6)(both inclusive), an employee may, with previous intimation to the Management in writing, contest elections to the University Senate in accordance with the provisions laid down in the respective non-Agricultural University Acts, or as the case may be, to the Maharashtra Legislative Council as provided in Sub-clauses (b) and (c) of Clause (3) of Article 171 of the Constitution of India.\\n(2) Subject to the provisions of Sub-rules (3) to (6) (both inclusive), an employee may, with the previous permission of the Management in writing, contest election to public offices [other than those mentioned in Sub-rule (1)] at the Local, District, State or National level.\\n(3) Immediately after filing the nomination form for contesting such elections and the same being declared as valid, the employee shall proceed on leave due and admissible to him; and if no leave is to his credit, he shall proceed on extraordinary leave, and shall continue to be on leave till the declaration of the election results.\\nProvided that the Management may require a temporary employee contesting such election to resign his post even during the election campaign, if in the opinion of the Management, the election campaign is likely to adversely affect the duties of the employee.\\n(4) The employee contesting such an election shall not involve the Management, employees or students of the Institution in which he is employed, in the election campaign.\\n(5)(a) In the event of his being elected the permanent employee shall apply for further extension of leave due and admissible to him and if no leave is at his credit, the extra-ordinary leave for the period for which he is likely to continue to hold the office; and the same shall be granted by the Management in relaxation of the limit prescribed in Sub-rule (13) of Rule 16.\\n(b) In case, however, if the sessions of meetings of the public office are held at intervals he may be allowed to avail himself of leave due and admissible to him or, as the case may be, the extra-ordinary leave, for the actual periods of the sessions or meetings including the periods of journey and may be allowed to attend the school during the remaining periods.\\n(c) The period of extra-ordinary leave availed of for the purpose, shall be counted for purposes of annual increments.\\n(6)(a) In the event of a permanent employee further becoming an office-bearer such as Chairman, President, Vice-President, Secretary, Joint Secretary, etc., which demands full-time attendance or long-time absence from normal duties, he shall apply for keeping his lien on the post which he held, which shall be granted by the Management.\\n(b) In the case of a non-permanent employee who is on leave till the declaration of election results, in the event of his being elected he shall resign the post he held immediately on his election to the public office.\\n(7) Provisions of Sub-rules (3), (4) and (5) shall mutatis mutandis apply to,-\\n(i) the permanent employees elected to public offices being further elected on the University Senate, or as the case may be, the State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, by virtue of their office;\\n(ii) the permanent employee nominated by the State Government on the State Board or Division Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education.\\nUnder Rule 42(3), it was open to the management, to allow an employee seeking leave to contest an election to proceed on leave. However, in extra-ordinary circumstances where it was felt, that the employees election campaign, was likely to adversely affect his duties, he could be required to tender his resignation. In furtherance of the request made by the Respondent seeking leave, the Appellant-society through its communication dated 31.01.1995, advised him to tender his resignation, Under Rule 42(3). The said advice was tendered specifically keeping in mind, the importance of the duties and responsibilities of the Respondent, in the background of the upcoming annual examinations. The Respondent did not accede to the suggestion made to him by the Appellant-society, through its communication dated 31.01.1995. All the same, he contested the election, and abstained himself from his duties, for the duration of the period for which he had applied for leave, for his election campaign. In the above view of the matter, we are satisfied, that the order of termination dated 16.02.1995 was fully justified, specially when the Respondent despite being asked, did not abide by the requirements indicated in the proviso to Rule 42(3) of the 1981 Rules. Having abstained from duties without leave, it was open to the Appellant-society to dispense with the Respondent\\'s services. It is clear that his services were dispensed with (by the order dated 16.02.1995), in compliance with Rule 42(3). Acceptance of the prayer of the Respondent, would have the result of interpreting the above Rule, as if it was of no consequence.\\n23. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are satisfied that both the orders of termination dated 30.03.1988 and 16.02.1995 were in consonance with law. Accordingly, the impugned order passed by the Bombay High Court on 28.10.2005 holding otherwise, is hereby set aside.\\n24. The instant appeal is allowed, in the above terms.\\n25. During the course of recording this order, it was pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Respondent, that the High Court by its order dated 05.03.1993 (in Writ Petition No. 232 of 1993) had allowed the Respondent to continue in service from year to year. Insofar as the arrears of salary payable to the Respondent is concerned, as a temporary arrangement, the High Court had directed the Appellant-society to pay the Respondent a sum of Rs. 15,000/-. It was submitted, that the aforesaid sum of Rs. 15,000/-, was paid by the Appellant-society to the Respondent, as far back as in 1993. Learned Counsel for the Respondent prays, that the above amount be not recovered from him, as the Respondent was not in a position to refund the same. Having given a thoughtful consideration to the instant issue, we are of the view, that the above amount paid to the Respondent, as far back as in 1993, should not be recovered from the Respondent. We order accordingly.\\n'),\n",

Export Import (EXIM) Policy 2002-2007 was framed by the Central Government Under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the \\'Act\\'), which came into force with effect from April 01, 2003. The main purpose and objective of this Policy was to boost the exports. In furtherance of the same, a Special Scheme containing the provisions thereof was incorporated therein which gave certain kind of incentives to the exporters of some specified items. However, some amendments were made thereto vide Notification No. 28 dated January 28, 2004. On the same day, Public Notice No. 40(RE-2003)/2002-2007 was also issued in exercise of powers conferred under the provisions of Para 2.4 of the said Policy, which was followed by Notification No. 38 dated April 21, 2004 and Notification No. 40 dated April 23, 2004.\\n2. Vide Notification No. 28 dated January 28, 2004, the Central Government sought to amend certain provisions of the EXIM Policy by inserting Notes 1 to 5, which was unpalatable to the exporters of the goods mentioned therein as, according to them, under the guise of the said Notes, some benefits which had already accrued to these exporters under the EXIM Policy were taken away. Vide Public Notice dated January 28, 2004, the Government announced exclusion of export performance in relation to four classes of goods mentioned in para 2 thereof from computation of the entitlement under the Scheme and, at the same time, sought to disallow the import of agricultural products falling under Chapters I to XXIV of ITC (HS) under the said scheme. Thereafter, Notification No. 38 dated April 21, 2004 was published Under Section 5 of the Act on the same lines on which Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 was issued. The exporters of these goods, naturally, felt aggrieved thereby. There was an innocuous amendment to Notification No. 38 dated April 21, 2004 wherein in addition to the Director General of Foreign Trade (for short, \\'DGFT\\') as an Officer to enforce these Notifications, ex-officio Additional Secretary to the Government of India was also added. All such exporters who were affected thereby filed writ petitions in various High Courts, particulars whereof shall be taken note of hereinafter at the appropriate stage.\\n3. The Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 2397 of 2004, decided on July 04, 2005, has given partial relief to the exporters/writ Petitioners. The Gujarat High Court has substantially affirmed the validity of these Notifications while giving relief on one particular aspect. Insofar as judgments of Bombay High Court and Gujarat High Court are concerned, both the Union of India as well as the writ Petitioners preferred Special Leave Petitions, in which leave was granted, and these are now converted as Civil Appeal No. 658 of 2006 and Civil Appeal 554 of 2006 respectively. That apart, the Single Judge of the Gujarat High Court in one of the cases dismissed the writ petition and the LPA was filed by the said Petitioner before the Division Bench of the High Court. Since the issue involved in these appeals is the same, which is raised in the LPA in the Gujarat High Court and still pending in the writ petitions filed in various High Courts, transfer petitions were filed by the Union of India seeking transfer of all those cases and to be heard along with these two appeals. Those transfer petitions were allowed. This is how all these cases are bunched together and heard simultaneously as the issue is substantially the same in all these matters.\\n4. With this background reflecting the nature of these cases, we now proceed to discuss the main provision of the EXIM Policy and how the aforesaid Notifications have amended the provisions of that Policy. That would give an indication as to what kind of grievance is raised by these exporters in challenging the validity of these Notifications.\\n5. The Act was passed to provide for the development and Regulation of foreign trade by facilitating imports into, and augmenting exports from India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of this Act stipulates that foreign trade is the driving force of economic activity. Technology, investment and production are becoming increasingly interdependent upon each other and foreign trade brings these elements together and spurs economic growth. The Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 was made in different circumstances. Although it has been amended from time to time, the Act does not provide an adequate legal framework for the development and promotion of India\\'s foreign trade. Besides, in July, 1991 and August, 1991, major changes in trade policy were made by the Government of India. The goals of the new trade policy are to increase productivity and competitiveness and to achieve a strong export performance. The Exports and Import Policy is a vital part of trade policy. The basic law governing foreign trade must serve as an instrument to create an environment that will provide a strong impetus to exports, facilitate imports and render export activity more profitable. It has, therefore, been considered necessary to enact a new law repealing the existing law. The Act intends to achieve these objectives.\\n6. In order to achieve the aforesaid objectives, power is given to the Central Government Under Section 3 of the Act to make provisions relating to imports and exports with primary focus on the development and Regulation of foreign trade. Further, Section 5 specifically empowers the Central Government to formulate and announce the EXIM Policy. It reads as under:\\n5. Export and import policy. - The Central Government may, from time to time, formulate and announce, by notification in the Official Gazette, the export and import policy and may also, in the like manner, amend that policy.\\n7. In order to carry out the purposes of this Act, DGFT is to be appointed by the Central Government as per the provisions of Section 6 of the Act. In addition to carrying out the purposes of this Act, DGFT is also supposed to advise the Central Government in formulation of the EXIM Policy. He is also made responsible for carrying out that Policy. However, Sub-section (3) of Section 6 empowers the Central Government to give the aforesaid functions of the DGFT even to other Officer subordinate to DGFT, except for powers conferred Under Sections 3, 5, 15, 16 and 19 of the Act.\\n8. As already noted above, Sections 3 and 5 give certain powers to the Central Government and, therefore, these powers have to be exercised by the Central Government only and cannot be delegated to DGFT or an Officer subordinate to him. Sections 15 and 16 relate to appeal and revision which can be filed against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authority against any person committing contravention of provisions of the Act, Rules, Orders and EXIM Policy. Appeal lies to DGFT if the Adjudicating Authority, who passes the order, is an Officer subordinate to DGFT. In those cases, where the Adjudicating Officer is DGFT himself, appeal lies to the Central Government. Under Sections 16, revisionary powers are conferred upon the Central Government. These powers of appeal and revision also cannot be delegated by virtue of Section 6(3) of the Act. Section 19 again confers power upon the Central Government to make Rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act generally and in respect of various matters specifically enumerated in Sub-section (2) of Section 19. This power of the Central Government also cannot be delegated.\\n9. It may be noted that Under Section 5 of the Act, the Central Government has been formulating EXIM Policies from time to time. The Policy with which we are concerned is the EXIM Policy for the period 2002-2007, which was substituted by EXIM Policy 2004-2009.\\n10. EXIM Policy of 2002-2007 was announced and came into force from April 01, 2002. Amendment to this Policy was notified on March 31, 2003 and the revised edition of the Policy was to come into force from April 01, 2003. Even though the Central Government is generally entitled and empowered to carry out amendments in this Policy from time to time, in the EXIM Policy 2002-2007, such a right was specifically reserved stating that \\'however, the Central Government reserves the right in public interest to make any amendments to this Policy in exercise of powers conferred by Section 5 of the Act\\'. It was also mentioned that such amendments would be made by means of a notification published in the Gazette of India.\\n11. Chapter I of the Policy, which gives \\'Introduction\\', had made transitional arrangements vide para 1.2 thereof clarifying that any notifications made or public notices issued or anything done under the provisions of EXIM Policy and in force immediately before the commencement of the said Policy shall continue to be in force, insofar as those notifications, etc. are not in consistent with the provisions of the instant Policy. It was also clarified that licences/certificates/permissions issued under the earlier Policy would continue to be followed for the purpose for which such licences/certificates/permissions were issued, unless otherwise stipulated. Para 1.4 enshrines the objectives which led to formulation of such a Policy and reads as under:\\n1.4 The principal objectives of this Policy are:\\n(i) To facilitate sustained growth in exports to attain a share of at least 1% of global merchandise trade.\\n(ii) To stimulate sustained economic growth by providing access to essential raw materials, intermediates, components, consumables and capital goods required for augmenting production and providing services.\\n(iii) To enhance the technological strength and efficiency of Indian agriculture, industry and services, thereby improving their competitive strength while generating new employment opportunities, and to encourage the attainment of internationally accepted standards of quality.\\n(iv) To provide consumers with good quality goods and services at internationally competitive prices while at the same time creating a level playing field for the domestic producers.\\n12. Keeping in mind the aforesaid principal objectives, para 2.1 made it clear that exports and imports shall be free, except in cases where they are regulated by the provisions of the said Policy or any other law for the time being in force. As per para 2.4, DGFT was authorised to specify the procedure which needs to be followed by an exporter or importer or by any licencee or other competent authority for the purposes of implementing the provisions of the Act, the Rules and the Orders made therein and this Policy. Such a procedure was to be stipulated and included in the Handbook (Volume-I), Handbook (Volume-II), Schedule of DEPB and in ITC (HS) and published by means of a public notice. It was permissible to amend this procedure from time to time.\\n13. Another provision of this Policy which needs to be noticed is para 2.34 that pertains to \\'third party exports\\' and reads as under:\\n2.34 Third party exports, as defined in paragraph 9.55 shall be allowed under the Policy.\\n14. Since the third party exports are to be allowed, as defined in para 9.55, we reproduce herein the said para as well:\\n\"Third-party exports\" means exports made by an exporter or manufacturer on behalf of another exporter(s). In such cases, shipping bills shall indicate the name of both the exporter/manufacturer and exporter(s).\\n15. Registration by importer or exporter is needed to avail the benefits of this Policy and provision in this respect is contained in para 2.44 mentioning about the Registration-cum-Membership Certificate, which reads as under:\\n2.44 Any person, applying for (i) a licence/certificate/permission to import/export, [except items listed as restricted items in ITC (HS)] or (ii) any other benefit or concession under this policy shall be required to furnish Registration-cum-Membership Certificate (RCMC) granted by the competent authority in accordance with the procedure specified in the Handbook (Vol. I) unless specifically exempted under the Policy.\\n16. Chapter III of the EXIM Policy deals with \\'Promotional Measures\\' which are to be undertaken to achieve the objective of the Policy. Apart from various other measures stipulated therein, with which we are not concerned, this Chapter also deals with grant of \\'Status Certificate\\' which is to be given to various kinds of exporters etc. who are eligible for such recognition. Categories of the exporters are mentioned therein depending upon the export performance level achieved by such export houses. Such status holders are eligible for certain special facilities which could be availed during the validity period of the Policy, i.e. April 01, 2002 to March 31, 2007, unless otherwise specified. Since all the Petitioners who filed the writ petitions have this Status Certificate, on the strength of which they are claiming the special facilities, and in their perspective the impugned notifications adversely affect the availment of these facilities, we reproduce verbatim concerned paras of the Policy touching upon this aspect:\\nWe now advert to the most crucial provision which entitles these Status Holders to the following benefits:\\nThe exporters who gets the Status Certificate are known as \\'Status Holders\\'. The term \\'Status Holder\\' is defined in para 9.53 and reads as under:\\n\"Status Holder\" means an exporter recognised as \"Export House/Trading House by DGFT/Development Commissioner or Star Trading House/Super Star Trading House\" by the Director General of Foreign Trade.\\n17. As noted above, the main objective of this EXIM Policy was to achieve the share of 1% of global trade and accelerated growth in exports. For this purpose, certain sectors, where such exports were to be given the necessary boost, were mentioned in para 3.10 describing them as \\'Thrust Sector\\'. These are as under:\\n3.10 With a view to achieve the share of 1% of global trade and accelerated growth in exports, the following shall be the thrust sectors:\\na) Electronic hardware\\nb) Textile including garments\\nc) Auto components/ancillary\\nd) Gem & Jewellery\\ne) Agriculture\\nf) Service sector\\nDepartment of Commerce shall take concerted efforts to promote exports of these sectors by specific sectoral strategy.\\n18. It is already noted above in para 3.7.1 that various kinds of categories are eligible for recognition as status holders. These include Export Oriented Units (EOUs), Electronic Hardware Technology Parks (EHTPs) and Software Technology Parks (STPs). A separate Chapter, i.e. Chapter VI, is carved out to deal with the aforesaid categories. Eligibility thereof is stipulated in para 6.1, which is to the following effect:\\n19. Such EOUs/EHTPs/STPs are permitted to export goods through status holder, as specifically provided in para 6.10 and we reproduce hereunder:\\n20. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are also entitled for Status Certificate. The provisions concerning these SEZs are contained in Chapter VII of the EXIM Policy. Their eligibility is defined in para 7.1 in the following words:\\n21. Para 7.8 deals with DTA Sales and Supplies which these SEZ Units ma undertake. These SEZ Units are also entitled to export through status holder in terms of para 7.10, as under:\\n22. Chapter IX contains definition of various terms which are used in the EXIM Policy. We have already noted the definition of \\'Status Holder\\' as well as \\'Third Party Exports\\'. Some other definitions which require a mention are as under:\\n23. To put it in nutshell, EXIM Policy 2002-2007 was promulgated with the principal objective, inter alia, to facilitate sustained growth in exports to achieve a share of 1% of global merchandise trade. Therefore, the thrust of this Policy was to ensure and facilitate growth in exports. Because of this reason, exports and imports were made free, except in relation to cases where they were specifically regulated by the provisions of this Policy or under any law. In order to facilitate the growth of these exports, following measures were specifically provided in the EXIM Policy:\\n(a) third party exports;\\n(b) stipulating thrust sector, viz. mentioning those products which were having potential in achieving the target of 1% of global trade and accelerated growth in exports. It was, therefore, perceived that in these sectors there is an ample scope for boosting the exports. Six such sectors mentioned in para 3.10 include Gem and Jewellery Sector as well;\\n(c) it was held that growth in exports can be accelerated through small scale industry sector/mid level export houses. For this purpose, depending upon the level of export by the exporters, categories of the exporters were carved out, namely, Export Houses, Trading Houses, Star Trading Houses and Super Star Trading Houses. In order to encourage these export categories, depending upon their category, the export incentives were provided for them;\\n(d) in the same direction, certain categories were chosen for giving recognition as status holders, who could get such Status Certificate if they come within the purview of the definition of \\'Status Holder\\' contained in para 9.55.\\n24. The importance that was given to these status holders was highlighted by the then Commerce Minister while announcing special strategic package for status holders. Relevant extract of the said speech contained in para 19 thereof is noted as under:\\n19. The status holders have been a pillar of strength in increasing exports. There is a feeling among them that under the Exim Policy, substantive benefits are no longer available to them since the earlier benefits such as fast track clearance and relaxation from certain procedures, are now universally applicable in the liberalized environment. We recognize that the status holders will continue to play a significant and increasing role in boosting exports, particularly from the small scale sector, as most of the small scale units will not be in a position to directly access the international markets. Moreover, it will be our endeavor to facilitate India emerging as a major base for outsourcing products and services for the rest of the world. They are also critical to our strategy for accelerating the rate of incremental growth of exports. Therefore, we intend to give a premium to the status holders who achieve high growth rate in their exports. It is proposed to give a duty free entitlement to them for import of capital goods, spares, office equipments and consumables. This will be available to status holders who achieve a growth rate of 25% or more in the current year with a minimum export performance of Rs. 25 crore. They would be entitled to a duty free entitlement of 10% of the incremental growth in exports during the current financial year. This entitlement would be subject to actual user condition which can be passed on to associate manufacturers.\\n25. In fact, as a part of the EXIM Policy, with amendment coming into effect from April 01, 2003, certain incentives known as \\'Special Strategic Package\\' for status holders was incorporated in para 3.7.2.1. We are concerned with sub-para (vi) thereof, which granted duty free entitlement of 10% of the incremental growth in exports. This para is reproduced above. A reading of the said para would demonstrate that in order to have the aforesaid entitlement, following conditions were to be satisfied:\\n(a) the exporter had to be \\'Status Holder\\';\\n(b) achieving incremental growth of more than 25% in FOB value of exports in free foreign exchange;\\n(c) minimum export turnover of Rs. 25 crores in free foreign exchange;\\n(d) entitlement could be used for import of capital goods, office equipment and inputs for their own factory or the factory of the associate/supporting manufacturer/job worker;\\n(e) such entitlement/goods was non-transferable; and\\n(f) since the Scheme was intended to be a specific incentive for fast growing status holders, the benefits were to be available only after April 01, 2004 on the basis of the export performance during the period April 01, 2003 to March 31, 2004.\\n26. On the very same day, i.e. on March 31, 2003, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5 of the Act, read with para 1.1 of the EXIM Policy 2002-2007, the Central Government amended and notified the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 (revised edition: March 2003). The revised edition came into force with effect from April 01, 2003. The relevant provisions of the EXIM Policy, as amended upto March 31, 2003, and relevant for the purpose of the present case, are paras 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10 and the same are reproduced below:\\n1.1 In exercise of the powers conferred Under Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 (No. 22 of 1992) the Central Government hereby notifies the Export and Import Policy for the period 2002-2007.

Licence/certificate/permissions issued before the commencement of this Policy shall continue to be valid for the purpose for which such licence/certificate/permission was issued unless otherwise stipulated.\\n1.3. In case an export or import that is permitted freely under this policy is subsequently subjected to any restriction or Regulation, such export or import will ordinarily be permitted notwithstanding such restriction or Regulation, unless otherwise stipulated, provided that the shipment of the export of import is made within the original validity of the irrevocable letter of credit established before the date of imposition of such restriction.\\nxxx\\n2.2. Every exporter or importer shall comply with the provisions of Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act 1992, the Rules and Orders made thereunder, the provisions of this Policy and the terms and conditions of any licence/certificate/permission granted to him, as well as provisions of any other law for the time being in force. All imported goods shall also be subject to domestic laws, rules, orders, Regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms as applicable to domestically produced goods. No import or export of rough diamonds shall be permitted unless the shipment parcel is accompanied by Kiberley Process (KP) Certificate required under the procedure specified by the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).\\n2.3. If any question or doubt arises in respect of the interpretation of any provision contained in this Policy, or regarding the classification of any item in the ITC (HS) or Handbook (Vol. I) or Handbook (Vol. 2), or Schedule of DEPB Rate the said question of doubt shall be referred to the Director General of Foreign Trade whose decision thereon shall be final and binding.\\nIf any question or doubt arises whether a licence/certificate/permission has been issued in accordance with this Policy or if any question or doubt arises touching upon the scope and content of such documents, the same shall be referred to the Director General of Foreign Trade whose decision thereon shall be final and binding.\\n2.4. The Director General of Foreign Trade may, in any case or class of cases, specify the procedure to be followed by an exporter or importer or by any licensing or any other competent authority for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act the Rules and the Orders made thereunder and this Policy. Such procedures shall be included in the Handbook (Vol. 1), Handbook (Vol. 2), Schedule of DEPB Rate and in ITC (HS) and published by means of a public notice. Such procedures may, in like manner, be amended from time to time.\\nThe Handbook (Vol. 1) is a supplement to the EXIM Policy and contains relevant procedures and other details. The procedure of availing benefits under various schemes of the Policy are given in the Handbook (Vol. 1).\\nxxx\\n2.6. DGFT may, through a notification, adopt and enforce any measure necessary for:\\n(i) Protection of public morals.\\n(ii) Protection of human, animal or plant life or health.\\n(iii) Protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights and the prevention of deceptive practices.\\n(iv) Prevention of prison labour.\\n(v) Prevention of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value.\\n(vi) Conservation of exhaustible natural resources.\\n(vii) Protection of trade of fissionable material or material from which they are derived; and\\n(viii) Prevention of traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war.\\nxxx\\n2.8.

No person may claim a licence/certificate/permission as a right and the Director General of Foreign Trade or the licensing authority shall have the power to refuse to grant or renew a licence/certificate/permission in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.\\n2.10 If a licence/certificate/permission holder violates any condition of the licence/certificate/permission or fails to fulfill the export obligation, he shall be liable for action in accordance with the Act, the Rules and Orders made thereunder, the Policy and any other law for the time being in force.\\n27. On March 31, 2003, in exercise of the powers conferred under paragraph 2.4 of the EXIM Policy, 2002-207, the DGFT notified the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-I) (Revised Edition-March 2003) which was to come into effect with effect from April 01, 2003. Para 3.2.5 of the same provided that:\\nThe status holders having an annual incremental growth of more than 25% in the FOB value of exports (in free foreign exchange) shall be entitled to the facility of duty free credit entitlement subject to achieving a minimum annual export turnover of Rs. 25 crore (in free foreign exchange). Such status holders shall be entitled to duty free credit entitlement certificate to the extent of 10% of the incremental growth in exports.\\nAccordingly, status holders who will achieve more than 25% growth in exports in the year 2003-04 (in free foreign exchange) as compared to the exports made in 2002-03 (in free foreign exchange) subject to a minimum export of Rs. 25 crore (in free foreign exchange) shall be entitled for duty free credit entitlement certificate @ 10% of the incremental growth in exports.\\nThe duty free credit entitlement can be used for import of capital goods, office equipments and inputs provided the same is freely importable under ITC (HS).

The application for the duty free credit entitlement certificate would be made in Appendix 17D.\\nThe duty free entitlement certificate shall be valid for a period of 12 months. The status holder shall within one month of the expiry of the validity of the duty free entitlement certificate, submit a statement of imports made under the certificate as per Appendix 17E to the jurisdictional Regional Licensing Authority.\\n28. After taking stock of the main provisions of the EXIM Policy which concern us in these proceedings, we now advert to the nature of amendments made by Notification dated January 28, 2004 as well as Public Notice of even date, followed by Notification No. 38 dated April 21, 2004.\\n29. Vide Notification No. 28 dated January 28, 2004, which was issued in exercise of powers contained in Section 5 of the Act read with para 1.1 of the EXIM Policy, certain amendments were made in the EXIM Policy. However, we are concerned here with amendment in para 3.7.2.1 in Chapter III. As noted above, this para provides certain incentives and contains seven sub-paragraphs. After sub-paragraph (vii), five notes were inserted by way of amendment. Though some provisions of Note I are the bone of contention, we reproduce here all these Notes for better understanding:\\nNote 1 - For the purpose of calculating the value of exports, the following exports shall not be taken into account, namely:\\n(i) re-export of imported goods or exports made through transshipment;\\n(ii) export turnover of units operating under SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STP Schemes or products manufactured by them and exported through DTA units;\\n(iii) deemed exports (even when payments are received in free foreign exchange) and payment from EEFC account;\\n(iv) service exports;\\n(v) supplies made by one status holder to another status holder;\\n(vi) export performance made by one status holder on behalf of other status holder will not be eligible for entitlement under the scheme;\\n(vii) supplies made or export performance effected by a non-status holder (Merchant exporter/Manufacturer with any export performance in 2003-04) to a status holder if the applicant as well as the non status holder have less than 25 per cent incremental growth over their respective previous years direct export turnover; and\\n(viii) the exports made by an applicant within a group and the group to which it belongs has individually less than 25 per cent incremental growth of export.\\nNote 2 - The incremental growth of exports by an exporter shall not, directly or indirectly, be transferred to any other exporters.\\nNote 3 - Government reserved the right in public interest, to specify the export products, which shall not be eligible for calculation of incremental growth/entitlement. Similarly, the government may also notify the list of goods, which shall not be allowed for imports under the scheme.\\nNote 4 - These guidelines will be applicable to the exports made on or after 1.04.2003.\\nNote 5 - The entitlement will be in terms of duty credit.\\nTo point out here itself, challenge was laid to sub-note (ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Note 1.\\n30. Sub-paragraph (3) of the para 3.8 pertaining to the \"duty free credit entitlement for service providers\" was amended to read as under:\\nService provider (other than hotels) shall be entitled to duty free import equivalent to 10% of the average foreign exchange earned by them in preceding three licensing years. However, hotels (one star and above), heritage hotels, stand-alone restaurants approved by Department of Tourism, Govt. of India and other service providers in tourism sector registered with Department of Tourism, Govt. of India, and shall be entitled for duty free imports equivalent to 5% of the average foreign exchange earned by them in free imports equivalent to 5% of the average foreign exchange earned by them in preceding three licensing years. For one & two star hotels and stand-alone restaurants, the foreign exchange earned through international credit cards only shall be taken into account for the entitlement under the scheme. The duty free entitlement shall be used for import of any capital good including spares, office equipment(s) & professional equipment(s), office furniture(s) & consumables. However, agriculture, diary products motor cars sports utility vehicles and all purpose vehicles would not be allowed to be imported against this entitlement.\\n31. Vide Public Notice bearing No. 40 dated January 28, 2004, which was issued along with the aforesaid Notification No. 28 on the same date, certain amendments were made in the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-I). This Public Notice was issued by the DGFT in exercise of powers conferred under para 2.4 of the EXIM Policy. By this Public Notice, paragraph 3.2.6 was inserted below para 3.2.5 of the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-I), which reads as under:\\nThe scheme will be applicable to status holders who were also status holders as on 31.3.2003 and who had achieved minimum export turnover of 25 crores in the year 2003-04:\\nI. For direct as well as third party exports, the Export documents viz. Export Order, Invoice, GR Form, Bank Realization Certificate should be in the name of applicant only. However, for the third party exports, where goods have been procured from a manufacturer, the shipping bill should contain the name of the exporter as well as the supporting manufacturer.\\nII. Goods allowed to be imported under this scheme shall have a nexus with the products exported and a declaration in this regard shall be made by the applicant in Appendix 17D.\\nIII. The licensing authority shall at the time of issuance of the duty free credit entitlement certificate endorse the name of the associate manufacturer/supporting manufacturer/job worker on the certificate as declared by the applicant. Goods imported against such entitlement certificate shall be used by the status holder or his supporting manufacturer/job worker in proportion to the value of their direct contribution to the entitlement.\\nIV. The last date for filing of such applications shall be 31st December.\\nV. The duty free credit entitlement certificate shall be issued with a single port of registration. For each duty free credit entitlement certificate, split certificates subject to a minimum of Rs. 5 lakh each and multiples thereof may also be issued. A fee of Rs. 1000/- each shall be paid for each split certificate. However, a request for issuance of split certificate(s) shall be made at the time of application only and shall not be considered at a later stage.\\nVI. The duty free credit entitlement certificate shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of issue. The status holder shall within one month of the last imports made under this certificate or within one month of expiry of the certificate whichever is earlier, submit a statement of imports/utilization made under the certificate as per Appendix 17E, to the jurisdictional Regional Licensing Authority who has issued the certificate with a copy to the jurisdictional excise authorities.\\nIt also provided that:\\nIn terms of para 3.2.5 of Handbook of Procedures (Volume 1), the following items would not be taken into account for computation of entitlement and export performance under Duty Free Credit Entitlement Scheme for Status Holders:\\na) Rough, uncut and semi polished diamonds.\\nb) Gold, silver in any form including plain jewellery thereof.\\nc) Good grains sourced from central pool maintained by FCI.\\nd) Items exported under free shipping bills.\\n3. In terms of para 3.2.5 of Handbook of Procedures (Volume 1) the following items would not be allowed for imports under Duty Free Entitlement Certificate for Status Holders:\\na) Agricultural products, which fall under Chapters 1-24 of ITC (HS) classification of Export and Import items.\\n32. We would like to mention at this stage itself that as per the Government rationale for the amendment brought out by Notification No. 28 dated 28.01.2004 and Public Notice No. 40 dated 28.01.2004 are as under:\\n33. M/s. Adani Export Limited, on February 07, 2004, filed S.C.A. No. 1676 of 2004 in the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad challenging the validity of the Notification No. 28 and Public Notice No. 40 dated January 28, 2004.\\n34. Thereafter, as noted above, Notification No. 38 dated April 21, 2004 was issued vide which Note 6 and 7 were inserted in para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy. It may be recalled that first five notes were inserted by Notification No. 28 dated January 28, 2004. By Note 6, certain products and category of products were excluded from entitlement under duty free entitlement certificate for status holders, whereas under Note 7, certain items were not allowed for imports under duty free entitlement certificate for status holders. These Notes read as under:\\nNote 6 - The export of the following products and categories of products would not be permitted for counting entitlement under the Duty Free Entitlement Certificate for Status Holders:\\ne) Rough, uncut and semi polished diamonds\\nf) Gold, silver in any form including plain jewellery thereof\\ng) Good grains sourced from central pool maintained by FCI\\nh) Items exported under free shipping bills.\\nNote 7 - The following items would not be allowed for imports under Duty Free Entitlement Certificate for Status Holders:\\nAgricultural products, which fall under Chapters 1-24 of ITC (HS) classification of Export and Import items.\\nNote 6 added in para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy was earlier inserted as part of para 3.2.6 in the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-I) and is subject matter of controversy.\\n35. On July 23, 2004, the High Court of Gujarat partly allowed Special Civil Application No. 1676 of 2004 holding that \"so far as Note 6 to Para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy as inserted by the Government notifications dated April 21 and 24, 2004 and the D.G.F.T.\\'s public notice dated 28.01.2004 exclude the following exports from the benefit of the duty free import entitlement for the export status holders as contained in Para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy 2002-2007:\\n(i) Items exported under free shipping bills.\\n(ii) Gold, Silver in any form including plain jewellery thereof, insofar as the import of capital goods and office equipment for the factory of the associate/supporting manufacturer/job worker of the Petitioner Company is concerned.\\nThe High Court also clarified that the exports effected by a non status holder (without any export performance in the year previous to 2003-04) are eligible for the benefits under the Special Scheme irrespective of the fact that such exporters did not have any incremental growth in exports, for obvious reason that they had made no exports in the previous years, in the first place.\\n36. Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court of Gujarat in Special Civil Application No. 1676 of 2004, M/s. Adani Exports on October 30, 2004 filed Special Leave Petition (Civil) No...CC 6638 of 2005.\\n37. On April 07, 2005 in exercise of the powers conferred under paragraph 2.4 of the Export & Import Policy 2002-2007, the Director General of Foreign Trade amended the first three lines of Para 3.2.6 of the Handbook of Procedures. The amended provision provided that:\\nThe scheme will be applicable to the status holders/star export houses who have achieved a minimum export turnover of Rs. 25 crores in the year 2003-2004.\\nIt also replaced the earlier appendix 17D prescribing the application format for claiming the Duty Free Credit Entitlement.\\n38. On July 04, 2005 Writ Petition No. 2397 of 2004 filed by M/s. Kanak Exports before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay challenging the Notification No. 28(RE-2003)/2002-2007 dated January 28, 2004, Public Notice No. 40(RE-2003)/2002-2007, Notification No. 38 (RE-2003) 2002-2007, came up for hearing before a Division Bench of High Court and upon hearing the parties, the High Court of Judicature at Bombay upheld the validity of Notification No. 28(RE-2003)/2002-2007 dated January 28, 2004. However, it set aside the Public Notice No. 40 dated January 28, 2004 and further held that the Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004 have only prospective operation which means that exports made by the exporters Respondent prior to April 21, 2004 in respect of the classes of goods covered by Notifications dated April 21/23, 2004 were entitled to be computed for the purposes of determining the entitlement of Duty Free Imports.\\n39. On October 21, 2005, this Court issued notice on the Special Leave Petition as well as on application for condonation of delay in the Special Leave Petition (C) (CC No. 6638 of 2005) filed by M/s. Adani Export Ltd.\\n40. On December 13, 2005, aggrieved by the order of Bombay High Court dated July 04, 2005 in W.P. No. 2397 of 2004 upholding the validity of the Notification No. 28 of 2004 dated January 28, 2004, M/s. Kanak Exports filed Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 26123 of 2005.\\n41. Aggrieved by the order of the Bombay High Court dated July 04, 2005 in Writ Petition No. 2397 of 2004, the Appellant/Union of India and DGFT filed Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 1331 of 2006.\\n42. On January 13, 2006 Special Leave Petition (C) No. 26123 of 2005 filed by M/s. Kanak Exports and Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 1331 of 2006 filed by the Appellants/Union of India and DGFT challenging the order of the Bombay High Court dated July 04, 2005 in W.P. (C) No. 2397 of 2004 came up for hearing before this Court.\\nThis Court upon hearing the parties granted leave in the Special Leave Petition (C) No. 1331 of 2006 and in the meantime stayed the operation of the impugned order in Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 1331 of 2006.\\n43. On February 17, 2006, the Union of India and DGFT aggrieved by the judgment and order of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 1676 of 2004 dated July 23, 2004 filed the Special Leave Petition.\\n44. The High Court of Gujarat, in the lead case Adani Exports Ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr. Special Civil Application No. 1676 of 2004, had rendered its judgment on July 23, 2004, which was available with the High Court of Bombay when it gave its decision on July 04, 2005. Insofar as the Gujarat High Court is concerned, it partly allowed the petition quashing Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 and Note 6 to Para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy, as inserted by the Government Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004 and rejected the challenge on all other counts. The Bombay High Court substantially followed the same line of action, except differing with the Gujarat High Court to a limited extent thereby granting some more relief to these Petitioners. Since these two judgments are the subject matter of these appeals, it would be apposite to scan through these judgments to find out what actually is decided by the two High Courts and the reasons in support of their respective decisions.\\n45. JUDGMENT OF THE GUJARAT HIGH COURT\\nIn the Special Civil Application filed by Adani Exports Limited in the Gujarat High Court challenge was laid to the amendment to para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy vide Notification dated January 28, 2004 whereby five Notes were inserted. It also challenged insertion of Note 6 vide Notification dated April 21, 2004 read with Notification dated April 23, 2004 and Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 issued by the DGFT. The validity of the aforesaid provisions was questioned on the following premise:\\n(i) Since Note 4 provided that the guidelines would be applicable to exports made on or after April 01, 2003, Notification was challenged on the ground that it amounted to giving retrospective effect to the amendment Notification dated January 28, 2004 and there was no such power with the Central Government Under Section 5 of the Act, or otherwise, to make amendments to the EXIM Policy with retrospective effect, or even retroactively.\\n(ii) These Notes, particularly Notes 1 to 3, 6 and 7, added by the impugned Notifications were not mere guidelines or clarificatory in nature, but amounted to making substantial changes by inserting new conditions under the cover of clarification, which was not permissible.\\n(iii) Note 4 was also violative of the Petitioners fundamental rights Under Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\n(iv) Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel was also invoked by contending that acting upon the EXIM Policy, which came into effect from April 01, 2003, the Petitioners had exported the goods on the promise and assurance contained in sub-para (vi) of Para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy and fulfilled the conditions set out therein, thereby achieving the target of incremental exports stipulated in the said para and, thus, became entitled to the benefit conferred therein, namely, 10% duty free imports of the specified items. The Petitioner had, therefore, altered its position and the Respondents were estopped from going back on their promises and assurances.\\n(v) Insofar as Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 is concerned, paragraphs 2 and 3, whereby certain items of goods which were exported were excluded from the purview of the special scheme, were challenged on the ground that they were ultra vires the powers of the DGFT as it amounted to usurping the power of the Central Government.\\n(vi) Insofar as Notification dated January 28, 2004 read with Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004 is concerned, challenge laid thereon was on the ground that they could not be made effective retrospectively.\\n46. The stand of the Union of India/Respondents was that Notification dated January 28, 2004 was only clarificatory in nature. Detailed justification for laying down these \\'clarifications\\' were given stating that large number of representations were received from Trade Associations/Export Promotion Councils as well as individual exporters seeking clarification on various points relating to the implementation of the Scheme. At the same time, the Government had also received information that many exporters were trying to misuse the same and details thereof, including the investigation/inquiry that followed, were also given and all this necessitated issuance of Notification dated January 28, 2004, in public interest. Other arguments of the Petitioners were also refuted giving various justifications. It was also emphasized that Section 5 of the Act and para 1.1 of the EXIM Policy reserved the right of the Government to amend the Policy in public interest. It was argued that a statutory power to amend the Policy, after noticing the misuse of the Policy, for the purpose for which it was never intended, cannot be frustrated on the plea that the Petitioners had a legitimate expectation that they can continue to exploit the Policy for a purpose totally different from the one for which it was intended and then expect that the Government would not take any action whatsoever. It was argued that the writ Court would not sit in appeal over the wisdom of the Government in such economic matters and the Government must have the freedom to experiment and must be allowed to adopt the \"trial and error method\". It was also argued that economic decision, as contained in the Notifications granting monetary benefits, can be withdrawn even before the expiry of the period for which the benefit was originally given if the decision of the Government is based on relevant material justifying such clarification or even change of the Policy.\\n47. After taking note of the aforesaid submissions of both the parties, the High Court stated certain legal principles referring to few judgments of this Court, which it deemed necessary to bear in mind, as they reflected the caveat sounded in those judgments. In this behalf, it quoted the following passage from the judgment of this Court in \\nState of M.P. and Others Vs. Nandlal Jaiswal and Others, \\n, which guides as to how the Courts have to deal how with the challenge to a policy decision of the Government in economic matters:\\n34...We had occasion to consider the scope of interference by the Court Under Article 14 while dealing with laws relating to economic activities in \\nR.K. Garg and Others Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Others, \\n. We pointed out in that case that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion, etc. We observed that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait-jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. We quoted with approval the following admonition give by Frankfurter, J. in Morey v. Dond [ 354 US 457]:\\nIn the utilities, tax and economic Regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial self-restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment. The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility. The courts have only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct. When these are added to the complexity of economic Regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to error, the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events-self-limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability.\\nWhat we said in that case in regard to legislation relating to economic matters must apply equally in regard to executive action in the field of economic activities, though the executive decision may not be placed on as high a pedestial as legislative judgment insofar as judicial deference is concerned. We must not forget that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call \\'trial and error method\\' and, therefore, its validity cannot be tested on any rigid \\'a priori\\' considerations or on the application of any straight-jacket formula. The court must while adjudging the constitutional validity of an executive decision relating to economic matters grant a certain measure of freedom or \\'play in the joints\\' to the executive. \"The problem of government\" as pointed out by the Supreme Court of the United States in Metropolis Theatre Co. v. State of Chicago [57 L Ed 730]:\\nare practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations, illogical, it may be, and unscientific. But even such criticism should not be hastily expressed. What is best is not discernible, the wisdom of any choice may be disputed or condemned. Mere errors of government are not subject to our judicial review. It is only its palpably arbitrary exercises which can be declared void.\\nThe Government, as was said in Permian Basin Area Rate cases [20 L Ed (2d) 312], is entitled to make pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances. The Court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by the State Government merely because it feels that another policy decision would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or logical. The Court can interfere only if the policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide.\\n48. The Court then observed that these principles were reiterated in \\nZippers Karamchari Union Vs. Union of India and Others, \\nand in \\nBALCO Employees Union (Regd.) Vs. Union of India and Others, \\n. Thereafter, the High Court referred to the various provisions of the EXIM Policy and the amendments made by the impugned Notifications as well as Public Notice, which have already been taken note of above.\\n49. The High Court thereafter adverted to three exclusions under Note 1 to Para 3.7.2.1 which, according to the writ Petitioner, had adversely affected their interest and these exclusions are:\\n(i) Export turnover of units operating under SEZ/EDU/THRP/STPI Schemes or products manufactured by them and exported through DTA units.\\n(ii) Supplies made by one status holder to another status holder.\\n(iii) Export performance made by one status holder on behalf of other status holder.\\n50. In the light of the above, the Court first discussed the propriety or validity of the Notification dated January 28, 2004 and pointed out that this Notification does not make \\'third party exports\\' illegal or entirely ineligible for getting incentive under the said Incentive Scheme for status holders. On the other hand, basic intention of the Scheme was to encourage the exports of products manufactured by small-scale industry sector, who do not have access to international market because of lack of required international marketing experience and the optimum resources to have presence in the international market arena. Therefore, the Scheme was not intended to encourage a status holder/export house to pool the exports made by existing exporters, i.e. who have exported in previous years as well, for the purpose of showing incremental growth in exports of the status holder. Similarly, supply of goods by a status holder, who is having the required marketing skill and has been exporting in previous years as well, to another status holder does not advance the purpose of the Scheme. Similarly, transferring export turnover of the supplier/exporter, who is the original export order holder, to the status holder for artificially enhancing the incremental growth of exports of the status holder will not further the object of the incentive scheme. Therefore, the Government stipulated through the impugned Notification dated January 28, 2004 that the condition of 25% incremental growth of exports will apply both to the Petitioner/status holder as well as to the supplier, whether the supplier is a status holder or is an existing supplier/exporter of goods. The clarifications made by the impugned Notification, insofar as they provide that the incremental growth of 25% in FOB value of exports is the criterion applicable both to the status holders as well as to the existing supplier/exporters, will have to be treated as clarificatory if the basic object of the incentive scheme is looked at. The object of the Scheme was to boost exports in actual terms and not merely to encourage the existing exporters to pool their exports for the purpose of giving artificial appearance of the incremental growth of exports.\\n51. On the aforesaid basis, the High Court concluded that the main purpose of the Notification dated January 28, 2004 was to prevent transfer of export orders from one group company to another company belonging to the same group in order to show enhanced export performance of such another company and, therefore, it was clarificatory in nature.\\n52. The Court then took up for consideration the argument of the writ Petitioner that the impugned Notification and Public Notice had the effect of taking away the vested right of the writ Petitioner, which was repelled in the following words:\\n17. Under the policy in force prior to the impugned notifications and even thereafter the third party exports are permitted. What the legal earlier is not made illegal at all. For instance, exports of goods manufactured by units in EDU/SEZ zones through status holder are not prohibited but such exports even made between 1.4.2003 and 27.1.2004, are excluded because the benefit of duty free import was already availed for the export of such goods. Chapter 6 of the Exim Policy relates to Exports Oriented Units (EDUs), Electronics Hardware Technology Parks (EHTPs) and Software Technology Parks (STPs). As provided in paras 6.1 and 6.8 of the Exim policy, these units undertake to export their entire production of goods and services, except permissible sales in the Domestic Tariff Area as per the Exim Policy. Para 6.2(b) of the Exim Policy provides that \"an EDU/EHTP/STP unit may import without payment of duty all types of goods, including capital goods, as defined in the Policy, required by it for its activities as mentioned in para 6.1....\\nPara 6.10 reads as under:\\n6.10 An EDU/EHTP/STP unit may export goods manufactured/software developed by it through a merchant exporter/status holder recognized under this Policy or any other EDU/EHTP/STP/SEZ unit.\\nThe amendments do not impinge upon the right of any party to export its goods in accordance with the Exim Policy. The clarification only excludes exports which were never intended in the first place to be covered by the Special Scheme under consideration.\\n18. Secondly, the misuse of the scheme by mere paper growth in exports is not to be countenanced. Hence, it is but natural that the notification dated 28.1.2004 would apply to the exports made from 1.4.2003 onwards. In so far as this Court holds that the Notes 1 and 2 read with Note 4 introduced by the notification dated 28.1.2004 are merely clarificatory, the exports made by the Petitioner between 1.4.2003 and 27.1.2003 (sic) would certainly be covered by the said notes. Two views were possible about the expression \"incremental growth in exports by 25%\" and the Government adopted the interpretation as reflected in the notification dated 28.1.2004 which is quite in consonance with the objects of the Act, Exim Policy and the Incentive Scheme rather than the interpretation canvassed by the Petitioner. Hence, there is no substance in the challenge to Notes 1 and 2 read with Note 4.\\n53. On the aforesaid basis, insofar as Notification dated January 28, 2004 is concerned, its validity has been upheld. The High Court then discussed validity of Public Notice of the even date. Observing that by this Public Notice certain export products from the Incentive Scheme were sought to be excluded and it could not be treated as mere clarifications, the High Court held that DGFT had no power to exclude exports of such groups merely by stating that rough diamonds or food items were to be excluded.\\n54. Since Notification dated April 21, 2004 read with Notification dated April 23, 2004 were issued whereby Note 6 was added, which was to the same effect as Public Notice dated January 28, 2004, and since this was held not to be merely clarificatory in nature, the Court went into the issue as to whether Notes 6 and 3 read with Note 4 were retroactive or retrospective. In the process, it dealt with the issue of \\'vested right\\' and after discussing the aforesaid legal concepts, it came to the conclusion that Notes 3, 6 and 4 were only retroactive in nature and not retrospective and since Notification dated January 28, 2004 (including Note 3 thereof) on exports made from April 01, 2003 was upheld as valid, Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004, flowing from the said Note 3 and adopting contents of Public Notice dated January 28, 2004, could not be faulted with on the ground of retrospectivity.\\n55. The Court then took the issue of Promissory Estoppel and discussed numerous case law on the subject and concluded that since it was a case of change in economic policy with future effect or retroactive effect only to \\'prevent manifest injustice or fraud\\', such public interest would override individual interest even if the promise cannot resume his position. On this basis, the argument based on the principle of Promissory Estoppel was rejected.\\n56. At the same time, exclusion of two items vide Note 6 in Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004 and Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 was found to be neither clarificatory nor in public interest and, therefore, bad in law. These are exclusion of following exports from the benefits of duty-free import entitlement for the export status holders:\\n(i) Items exported under free shipping bills.\\n(ii) Gold, silver in any form including plain jewellery thereof, in so far as the import of capital goods and office equipment for the factory of the associate/supporting manufacturer/job worker of the Petitioner Company is concerned.\\nThe Special Civil Application was allowed to the aforesaid extent directing that the aforesaid items cannot be excluded while computing the duty free import entitlement.\\n57. JUDGMENT OF THE BOMBAY HIGH COURT\\nThe Bombay High Court, in its impugned judgment dated July 04, 2005, has held as under:\\n(i) Notification dated January 28, 2004 is valid. It does not seek to amend the policy with retrospective effect but is only clarificatory in nature which was issued to stop the misuse and abuse of the scheme as the main purport of the scheme was to encourage the export of products and not to encourage the status holders/export user to pool the exports made by other exporters for the purpose of showing incremental growth in the export. Paras 19 and 20 of the High Court containing discussion on this aspect are noted below.\\n19. The reasons for making clarifications are contained in para 5 of the impugned Notification. It appears that after the scheme was initiated, on the basis of intelligence gathered the Central Government learnt that the scheme was being misused by certain status holders by entering into contracts with various exporters showing themselves as third party exporters. Such contracts were executed on stamp papers ostensibly showing such status holders as third party exporters holding other parties in obtaining the orders. These contracts were found to have been entered into between the parties as merely a paper arrangement with a view to claim benefits of duty free credit entitlement on the export of others. It also came to notice that the status holders were purchasing exports made by other parties at a premium with a view to show incremental growth of 25% or more in exports without having actually achieved such growth. In the face of this clear abuse of the scheme the Central Government had to intervene and issue the impugned Notification to clarify the correct meaning of the scheme. Note 2 of the Notification provides that incremental growth of exports by an exporter shall not, directly or indirectly, be transferred to any other exporter i.e. exporter\\'s own incremental growth will be counted for entitlement. The Appellants have not challenged the validity of Note 2. What is challenged is the validity of Note I which states that for the purpose of calculating the value of certain exports shall not be taken into account in respect of Sub-clauses (ii),(v),(vi) and (vii) thereof.\\n20. It appears that till 2002-2003 the Petitioners\\' export performance was going down steadily. In 2002-2003 the export of the Petitioners was hardly Rs. 27 crores. In the year 2002-2003 India\\'s export increased by 22% whereas as compared to the Petitioners\\' export of about Rs. 27 crores in 2002-2003, it catapulted to more than Rs. 1000 crores. The national export growth rate was only 22% while the Petitioners\\' exports grew at more than 3800%. It is obvious that this growth is merely a paper growth and not incremental growth within the meaning of the scheme. Notification dated 28th January 2004 does not make any third party export illegal or entirely ineligible for getting incentives under the Exim Policy. However, the basic intention of the amended scheme was to encourage the export of products manufactured by small scale units who do not have access to the international market because of lack of required international marketing expertise and optimum resources to have presence in the international marketing arena. The scheme was not intended to encourage the status holder/export house to pool the exports made by other exporters for the purpose of showing incremental growth in the export. The clarification issued by the impugned Notification in so far as it provides that supplies made by one status holder to another status holder or export performance made by one status holder on behalf of another status holder shall not be eligible for entitlement is in consonance with the basic object of the scheme. The export turnover of the units operating under STZ/EOU/EHTP schemes was also excluded as these units are getting all facilities for import without payment of duty on various types of goods including capital goods required by them for their activities. The intention of the makers of the scheme was not to confer double benefit under para 3.7.2.1. Further an exporter is required to export himself and not benefit from export capabilities of STZ/EOU/EHTP etc. This would be only paper growth and amount to abuse of the scheme. Reliance placed by the Petitioners on Circular No. 16 dated 24th December 2002 is also of no assistance as the said Circular stating that 3rd party exports are eligible for all the export promotion schemes was issued long before the special incentive scheme was announced on 31st March 2003. In our opinion, the provisions contained in the impugned Notification dated 28th January 2004 are merely clarificatory and cannot be treated as amendment to the scheme.\\nIn the process, the High Court rejected the contention of the writ Petitioners that the said Notification was unreasonable and irrational. The Court held that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and is based on experimentation of what one may call trial and error method and, therefore, its validity cannot be tested on any rigid prior considerations or on the application of any straightjacket formula.\\n(ii) Public notice dated January 28, 2004 issued by the DGFT has been held to be without jurisdiction inasmuch as DGFT has no power to do so Under Section 5 read with Section 3 of the Act. The Court held that by this Public Notice, four items were sought to be excluded from the purview of the scheme and, therefore, it amounted to amendment of the scheme which could be done by the Central Government only that too by means of Notification Under Section 5 of the Notification, clarified that power of the DGFT is only to be exercised for procedural purpose which was evident from para 2.1.4 of the EXIM Policy. On the other hand, para 3.2.6 inserted by Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 went beyond the procedural conditions as these conditions were not found in the Policy. According to the High Court, since the Notification was not clarificatory and it amounted to amendment of the policy which was statutory in nature, this form of delegated or subordinate legislation could be only prospective and not retrospective unless the rule making authority has been vested with the power under the Statute to make rules with retrospective effect.\\n(iii) Insofar as Notes (vi) and (vii) which were added vide Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004, the High Court took the view that they were not merely clarificatory in nature. It was pointed out that vide these Notifications, four items were sought to be excluded from the purview of the scheme and, therefore, could not be treated as merely clarificatory. The High Court, thus, while affirming the validity of these Notifications, came to the conclusion that it can be only prospective in nature.\\nContention of the Union that the word \"amend\" used in Section 5 read with Section 3 confers upon the Central Government to regulate, incorporates in its entrustment of the power to make subordinate legislation retrospectively, was turned down by the High Court. The High Court took the view that the word \"amend\" does not give power to make amendment retrospectively if it is used in relation to the power to make a piece of delegated legislation. The connotation of the word \"amend\" when it is used of the exercise of power by a legislature cannot be pressed to construe the word \"amend\" in relation to the power to make delegated legislation. In taking this view, the High Court relied upon the judgment of this Court in \\nAccountant General and Another Vs. S. Doraiswamy and Others, \\n.\\nAnother contention of the Union predicated on Section 21 of the General Clauses Act to buttress its submission that retrospective effect could be given to the Notification was also repelled. In the opinion of the High Court, Section 21 of the General Clauses Act embodies a realm of construction, nature and extent of application which must inevitably be governed by relevant provisions of the statute that confers power to issue the notification. The said power must be exercised within the limits prescribed by the provisions conferring such a power and if there was no specific power given to make amendment retrospectively, that could not be assumed on the ground that it was necessitated in public interest.\\nOn this aspect, the Bombay High Court did not agree with the view taken by Gujarat High Court which held that Notifications dated April 21 and 24, 2004 were merely retroactive and not retrospective, by giving following reasons:\\nThe Division Bench, however, proceeded to hold that the Notifications dated 21st/24th April, 2004 are merely retroactive and not retrospective. We may hasten to add that the Division Bench struck down the Notifications dated 21st/23rd April, 2004 as far as the free shipping bills and gold, silver and jewellery are concerned on the ground that exclusion of these items was unjustified and unreasonable. With great respect to the learned Judges we are unable to agree with the view that the amendment is merely retroactive. Once it is shown that the Central Government does not have the power to give retrospective effect to the amendment which is introduced in exercise of power conferred by Section 5 of the Foreign Trade Act then whether the said amendment is retro-active or retrospective is rather immaterial. The amendment has clearly an impact on the rights which are already crystallized. We have therefore no hesitation to hold that the Notifications dated 21st and 23rd April 2004 would have prospective operation only.\\nOUR ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS\\n58. The factual matrix, coupled with the arguments advanced before us by both sides, makes it clear that the issues remain the same which were canvassed before the High Courts. Even the position taken by the parties on either side is predicated on identical legal edifice. Before adverting to the analytical discussion and deciding the validity of impugned Notifications and public notice, keeping in mind the legal principles, we would like to first discuss the background in which they came to be issued. We feel that argument of the Union that these were issued in public interest has to be considered first as that would provide the raison d\\'etre behind such a move on the part of the Government. Therefore, the first question is:\\nWhether Notifications were issued in public interest?\\n59. The main objective of the scheme was to achieve the share of 1% of global trade and accelerated growth in exports. For this purpose, the scheme intended to concentrate on the growth of certain kinds of products treating the same as \"thrust sectors\". In para 3.10, six such sectors are mentioned as thrust sectors, viz., Electronic hardware, Textile including garments, Auto components/ancillary, Gem and jewellery, Agriculture and service sector. It would be significant to point out that except one, all other writ Petitioners belong to Gem and jewellery sector. One writ Petitioner has export in Textile/Garments. What is highlighted is that no thrust sector was affected or prejudiced by the impugned Notification and which was primarily Gem and Jewellery exporters who got the hit.\\n60. As a matter of fact, immediately after the introduction of the scheme, it was found that there was unprecedented sharp rise in the export in Gem and Jewellery articles. It raised certain suspicion in the mind of the authorities as to whether these were genuine exports. The matter was investigated and on the basis of intelligence gathered by the Central Government, it was learnt that there was rampant misuse of the scheme by certain status holders. On October 13, 2003, the then Joint Secretary, Government of India, Central Board of Excise and Customs addressed a letter to the then DGFT stating as follows:\\nIt has been reliably learnt that some status holders are trying to show growth in exports so as to avail the benefit of the aforesaid scheme. Such status holders are purchasing exports made by other parties at a premium with a view to show incremental growth of 25% or more in exports without having actually achieved such growth. Similarly some corporate groups having more than one exporting units are reportedly shifting exports in the name of any one status holder group company so as to artificially achieve incremental growth of 25% in exports. You would agree that the objective of DFCEC Scheme is to encourage status holders to achieve substantial growth in exports so that there is corresponding increase in the foreign exchange earnings of the country. It is, therefore, necessary to put suitable safeguards in DFCEC Scheme for Status Holders so that third party exports are not counted for the purpose of calculating the incremental growth in exports. Similarly, in case of corporate houses having more than one exporting companies, incremental growth may be calculated by taking into account the overall exports made by all the companies of that group. You may also like to provide for any other safeguards in DFCEC Scheme for Status Holders to ensure that the benefits of DFCEC Scheme is made available only to those status holders who actually achieve incremental growth of 25% or more in FOB value of exports during the financial year 2003-04 vis-à-vis to financial year 2002-03. One way to disallow DFCEC Scheme benefit to such artificial growth may be to define the term \"incremental growth in exports\" used in para 3.7.2.1(vi) of the EXIM Policy.\\n61. The said letter dated 14.10.2003 was forwarded to the Office of the Commissioner of Customs, Export Promotions to various Commissioners of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai on 05.11.2003 responded that:\\nThe Customs House at Mumbai has noticed exports of sugar by State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. showing account of Adani Export Ltd., Private Merchant Exporter. The invoice is that of State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. Mate Receipt shows receipts of goods from State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. As also the Bill of Lading shows the shipper as State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. However, the bank certificate of export and realization has been filed by Adani Exports Ltd. In which the exporter is shown as Adani Exports Ltd. Adani House, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad A/c State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. Photocopies of the set of documents is enclosed herewith. It is also to be pointed out that the DEPB benefit available on sugar is only 4% but under the incentive scheme the exporter is entitled to benefit of 4% plus additional 10%.\\nIf purchase of exports from third parties or shifting of exports from one company to the other in the group is inconsistent with the intention and objective of the scheme, then the flaw in the scheme is to be removed. The flaw is that third party exports are being permitted under the Foreign Trade as well as Customs Regulations. The flaw can be removed by amending para 3.7.2.1 of that Policy and the relevant customs notifications to provide that third party exports shall not be taken into account by the DGFT in computing the incremental growth and the FOB value qualifying for grant of Duty Fee Credit Entitlement Certificate.\\nThe scheme may be more precisely stated in the EXIM Policy and the Customs Notifications in accordance with the objectives and intentions of the Government so that what is plainly permitted by the scheme is not regarded subsequently as misuse or abuse of the scheme.\\nIt is also brought to the notice that it is open to the exporters to export under free Shipping Bill where as per the current instructions there is no scrutiny of Shipping Bills or physical examination of the goods. This would enable the unscrupulous exporters to inflate the FOB Value and get incremental growth and the additional benefit of 10% under DFCEC.\\n62. In a meeting held with the Officials of the DGFT and the Customs it was suggested as under:\\nFor calculation of incremental value the following should be excluded:\\n\\x95 Value of goods exported on re-export basis.\\n\\x95 Since the exports made by a subsidiary of a limited company are counted towards export performance of the limited company for the purpose of recognition, the value of export made by subsidiary company and its limited company shall be taken together to determine the incremental exports.\\n\\x95 In case of EOU/SEZ/STP/EHTP units, this facility shall not be available as such units are already eligible for duty free import of capital goods/raw materials/office equipments etc. Further the status holder which also has a DTA unit along with EOU/SEZ/STP/EHTP unit should be excluded for the purpose of determining of third party export.\\n\\x95 Value of third party export.\\n\\x95 In case of doubt regarding valuation of goods by Customs authorities, the value of goods as determined by Customs authority should be taken for determining incremental export instead of value declared by exporter.\\n\\x95 Value of exports made in terms of fulfillment of any export obligation under any export promotion scheme such as EPCG, Advance License etc.\\nFurther to plug the loopholes, there is need to incorporate the following safeguards in the scheme.\\n\\x95 It is essential to incorporate a provision in the scheme providing that the status holder availing the benefit of above said scheme and importing raw material shall not avail export incentive by way of drawback/DEPB on foods manufactured using such duty free inputs and their subsequent export.\\n\\x95 The possibility of excluding gems and jewellery exports may also be examined as the duty incidence on gold (less than 2%) silver (5%), rough diamond (0%), rough gemstones (0%), broken or semi-finished cut and polished diamonds (0%), cut and polished diamonds (15%) is low. In addition to low duty, several other incentives such as replenishment licence of 1% FOB Value of export for duty free import vide notification No. 41/99-Customs, dated 28-4-2003 are also available.\\nIn addition, we have several schemes such as:\\n\\x95 Exemption to gold/silver/platinum, alloys, findings, and mounting of gold/silver/platinum and plain semi-finished gold/silver/platinum Jewellery by nominated agencies, status holders or exporters of standing under the scheme for export against supply by foreign buyer (notification No. 56/2000 dated 5-5-2000).\\n\\x95 Scheme for providing replenishment license issued order under or in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of the EXIM Policy; and Gem Replenishment License issued under in accordance with paragraph 4.4.13 of the EXIM Policy-under these schemes, raw pearls, natural or cultures, and precious or semi-precious stones (other than rough diamonds), unset and uncut are allowed to be imported duty free.\\n\\x95 In addition to above, this sector has large potential to manipulate the value of goods and do the circular trading of goods by doing over-invoicing and under-invoicing. The receipt cases of large scale manipulation of value of rough diamonds is a clear example of this.\\n\\x95 There is need to clearly express in the scheme that value of only physical exports be taken into consideration and not the value of deemed exports.\\n\\x95 The Scheme is open ended and it does not have any linkage with foreign exchange realised. This aspect also needs careful re-examination.\\n63. On 19.11.2003, the Officer on Special Duty, Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue issued a Circular No. 98/2003 stating that:\\nCommissioner of Customs (Export), ACC, Sahar had raised an issue whether under DFCEC Scheme, import of all capital goods including professional equipments could be allowed. This doubt has also been created on account of usage of the words \"capital goods\" in condition (3) of Customs Notification No. 54/2003. This issue has been examined in consultation with DGFT/MOC. DGFT have confirmed that the objective of DFCEC Scheme for Services Providers is to permit import of aforesaid goods with a view to increase the capability of the services providers so as to enable him to render a better and efficient service. With this in mind import of professional equipments which are required in the profession of the service providers has been allowed. However, insofar as capital goods are concerned, its import to service provider has already been allowed through EPCG route. Therefore, insofar as DFCEC Scheme is concerned, under the category of professional equipments, import of only those equipments would be permissible under DFCEC Scheme, which are professional equipments required by the Service Provider for the purpose of rendering service & earning free foreign exchange. It is reiterated that import of capital goods which are other than professional equipment or office equipment shall not be allowed under DFCEC Scheme for Service Providers. In order to remove doubts, the words \"capital goods\" used in condition (3) of 54/2003-Cus dated 1.4.2003 has also been corrected to read as \"Professional equipment\" by issue of corrigendum.\\nSuitable Public Notice for Trade and Standing Order for the guidance of customs field may be issued.\\n64. In furtherance to the communications between the Department of Revenue and the Customs, a meeting was held in the Office of the DGFT on October 21, 2003 which was attended by ADG(SB), JS(SSR), JDG(MCJ), OSD(RKT) and DDGTM in the Chamber of DGFT under the Chairmanship of DGFT and with regard to the Duty Free Credit Entitlement Scheme a tentative decision was taken on the following lines to safeguard, avoid any fraud or misuse of the Scheme:\\n(a) The BRC and Shipping Bill and the GR Form should bear the name of the merchant exporter and the associate/supporting manufacturer in case of third party export.\\n(b) There should be a minimum growth of 25% in the exports of both supporting/associate manufacturers in case of third party export.\\n(c) For group companies, it was suggested that the export of different companies under a group may be clubbed so as to check the possibility of inter-company transfers within a group for showing artificial growth. However, the matter may be further examined to arrive at a solution.\\n(d) It was also decided to go through the other additional issues, if any, in the matter so that the proper guidelines can be issued as early as possible.\\n65. With regard to the import of capital goods under the Duty Free Credit Entitlement Scheme the matter was deliberated upon and it was decided not to allow all capital goods other than the professional equipment and office equipment mentioned in paragraph 3.8 of EXIM Policy against DFCE to service providers.\\n66. On December 11, 2003, the Additional Director General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence addressed a letter to the Joint Secretary, (Draw back), Ministry of Finance reiterating the suggestions made in the meeting held with the Officers of the DGFT and the Customs as stated herein above.\\n67. On December 23, 2003, the Office of the Chief Commissioner of Customs, Bangalore Zone, addressed a Communication to the Joint Secretary (Drawback), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Central Board of Excise and Customs inter alia indicating:\\n(i) In order to prevent misuse of the scheme, it is desirable to incorporate the following conditions in paras 3.7.2 and 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 while issuing the duty free import entitlement certificate.\\n(ii) White computing the incremental growth in FOB value of exports, only the value of exports, which have been made directly by the status holder as involved in the export documents and for which the export proceeds have been realized in the name of the status holders shall be taken into account.\\n68. Thereafter, on December 12, 2003, the Chief Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai addressed a communication to the Joint Secretary (Drawback), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue indicating that:\\nThe status holders as well as status holder corporate groups are showing artificial incremental growth of 25% in Exports(.) Even a Govt. of India undertaking, such as S.T.C. Limited have also sold their exports to another status holder(.)\\nIt is felt that the incentive scheme under DFCEC for 25% incremental growth in Exports during 2003-04 vis-à-vis 2002-03 has spurred this \"artificial clubbing of exports\"(.) However, the DGFTS clarificatory policy circular of 16/2002 dated 2.12.2002 envisages that allowing third party export is a conscious decision of the Government(.) It appears that in the face of the current policy provisions, the benefits allowed to third party exports cannot be legally denied(.) Hence it is proposed that Ministry may consider prevailing upon the Ministry of Commerce/DGFT to amend the EXIM Policy provisions, so as to incorporate Para 3.7.2.1(g) that for the purpose of calculating the incremental growth of 25% in exports in 2003-04, vis-à-vis 2002-03 the exports made on behalf of third parties will not be counted(.)\\nIt is further submitted that in order to show 25% incremental growth in the exports during the current financial year 2003-04 vis-à-vis exports made in 2002-03, unscrupulous elements may also resort to over invoicing of free shipping bill by inflating the FOB value in such exports as the same are not subject to rigours of customs assessment and physical examination(.) It may therefore be suggested to the Ministry of Commerce and DGFT that the value of the exports made under Free Shipping Bill may not be counted for the purpose of calculating 25% incremental growth in export under the DFCEC Scheme(.) Alternatively, the exporters claiming for incremental growth against free shipping Bills with the benefit of DFCEC Scheme should declare it in all such Shipping Bills, so that such exports could be put to rigors of customs scrutiny including valuation and physical examination(.)\\n69. Based on these Reports an exercise was initiated for carrying out amendments in the Handbook of Procedure (Volume-I) with series of meetings and Open Houses with the Apex Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Export Promotion Councils, Trade Associations, Commodity Boards. Based on these interfaces the lists of suggestions were compiled and the same discussed threadbare during internal deliberations.\\n70. There were a series of interactions with the other Ministries involving changes in the procedural aspects of the EXIM Policy as reflected in the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-1).\\n71. The individual divisions were allocated the task of amending the procedural aspects of the EXIM Policy. Inputs were received from the EPCG division headed by Addl. DGFT (MLB) which carried out changes in Chapter 5 of the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-1), PC II Division carried out changes in the Deemed export chapter and DES IV Division suggested changes in Chapter IV of the Handbook of Procedures (Volume-1).\\n72. Meetings were held with the (Drawback) Directorates on January 09, 2004 and January 21, 2004 culminating into a presentation to the Hon\\'ble Prime Minister on January 27, 2004 in the presence of the Commerce and Industry Minister, Finance Minister, Secretary Finance, Secretary Revenue, Secretary DGFT, Additional DGFT (Policy), Joint Secretary etc. wherein it was decided that salient changes should be brought in the Handbook of Procedure (Volume-1) to the following effect:\\nthe duty free entitlement for status holders has been fine tuned to obviate any possible misuse such as mandating the insertion of the exporter and third party\\'s name on the export documents, need to have nexus for import under the certificate vis-à-vis the exports made etc.\\n73. In the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, details of the modus operandi used by these exporters are given on the basis of which it is projected that these exporters indulged in inflating their exports by achieving a growth rate from 300% to 3800% when during the same period i.e. 2003-2004, the national growth of export was merely 18%. It is demonstrated by tabulating figures as follows:\\nIt is submitted that in case of M/s. Kanak Exports and M/s. Rajesh Exports, their export growth exceeded a growth rate of 2000% and their entire export comprises of gold coins and plain Jewellery. The relevant turnover of these companies for the year 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 is as under:\\nThat in case of M/s. Adani Exports, the Petitioner herein, their exports have grown by nearly 1135% and over 80% of their exports came from diamonds and supply taken from other status holders not meeting the minimum turn over of growth criteria. The said fact is clear from the following chart:\\nExport surge of 1135% for M/s. Adani Exports came in 2003-04 while for the past 6 years their exports were declining.\\nThe above said growth rate of the companies who have challenged the Notifications and the Public Notices, has been achieved on account of the following:\\nI-Purchase of exports\\nPurchase of the exports of other firms (who were not eligible to get the benefit of the scheme) by M/s. Adani Exports Ltd. to inflate their turnover. For this contracts were signed between the Petitioners and other exporters.\\nII-Export of rough diamonds\\nExport of rough diamonds by M/s. Adani Exports Ltd. Even through India is not a rough diamond producing country.\\nThese exports stopped the moment DFCE benefits were disallowed.\\n\\x95 Export of such rough diamonds earlier never been part of the normal commercial operations and has taken place just to take advantage of the Scheme.\\n\\x95 According to Gems and Jewellery export promotion council, \"India is not a rough exporting country. Rough diamonds which are unsustainable for cutting in India are re-exported.\" Such exports stopped the moment benefit was explicitly withdrawn.\\nIn the present case also the Respondent herein M/s. Adani Exports Limited had stopped exporting the rough diamonds the moment the Notification was issued in January, 2004 and according to Gems and Jewellery export promotion council, \"Party has not exported rough diamonds during Jan/March 2004.\\nIII-Export of gold coins, Jewellery-Circular trading and Exports to related companies\\nMost notorious misuse of the scheme was carried out by few firms who exported Gold medallion and studded jewellery. Key firms included M/s. Kanak Exports, M/s. Rajesh Exports Ltd. And M/s. Adani Exports Limited.\\nPetitioners exported to their own counterparts in Dubai and Sharjah. Since the jewellery attracted 5% import duty at Dubai, the consignments which were declared as jewellery in India were declared as scrap in Dubai to avoid the import duty.\\nThe export goods have been declared as \"Studded gold jewellery/CE Bangles\" at the Indian port, whereas at the port of destination they were cleared as gold scrap.\\nIn few consignments belonging to M/s. Adani Exports Ltd. and produced by M/s. Rajesh Exports as supporting manufacturer, the export products declared as \\'Bangles\\' were nothing but strips of gold formed into the shape of bangle and studded with cheap imitation stone.\\nThat as it was difficult for them to achieve the value addition prescribed by the Policy through craftsmanship, they added extra gold to get the value addition. However, in this process strangely enough per unit price of the gold exported was less than per unit price of gold imported.\\nThereby implying/demonstrating that there is a collusion between M/s. Adani Exports, Petitioner herein and M/s. Rajesh Exports, Appellant before the Karnataka High Court in order to misuse the policy.\\nWith the exports taking place within a day of the imports, gold can be circulated more than 100 times in a year. That means that an unscrupulous exporter can expect to earn Rs. 1500 for every Rs. 100 invested. As these are not commercial operations and export and import takes place between related parties, the illegitimate earnings are at the expense of the country.\\nIV-Export of cut and polished diamonds-Circular trading and Exports to related companies\\nAccording to reliable information the same sets of diamonds were rotating and these never entered the Indian domestic territory or to the end consumers abroad. The value of such exports in the past three years may exceed Rs. 15,000 crores. Government has detailed report of the modus operandi of the firms involved.\\nExports of cut and polished diamonds took place from small rooms of 10X12 feet where manufacturing activity was not allowed.\\nFirms like M/s. Adani Exports imported their consignments on re-export basis with artificial value addition and to buyers related to them.\\nPage 51 of Annual report 2001-02 of M/s. Adani Exports mentions the name of M/s. Gudami International of Singapore as the related party and associate entity. M/s. Adani Exports exported cut and polished diamonds to this entity. This indicates that the suppliers, exporters and importers were linked and hence the possibility of manipulating value addition.\\nAccording to one estimate the same set of diamonds were rotating and these never entered the Indian domestic territory or to the end consumers abroad.\\n74. It is also stated in the counter affidavit that the misuse of the scheme had also come to the notice of DRI and other intelligence officials who had gathered the necessary information and collected supported documents. Based on the intelligence gathered, a note on the misuse of Duty From Credit Entitlement (DFCE) and Target Plus Scheme was prepared which is annexed with the counter affidavit. At the time of arguments, Mr. Adhyaru, learned senior Counsel extensively read and profusely relied upon this note with his passionate plea that all these writ Petitioners have indulged in sharp practices in trying to take undue advantage of the scheme and, therefore, they should not be held entitled to the benefit of the scheme. It was also submitted that this material would clearly support the plea of the Government that the Notifications were issued to curb the misuse and were clearly in public interest. Exact summary and details of misuse as mentioned in the said note are as under:\\nExecutive Summary\\nThe following note is based on the intelligence gathered by the government. If needed copies of supporting documents may be produced.\\nSince the Scheme was based on growth of individual exports, many unscrupulous exporters resorted to inflating their export turnover mainly by following type of activities.\\nM/s. Adani Exports and few other exporters purchased the exports of other firms to inflate their turnover. Contracts have been signed between the Petitioners and other exporters that Petitioner will provide marketing and other services and act as third party exporter. According to the Department of Revenue, Status Holders were purchasing exports made by other parties by paying money with a view to show incremental growth of 25% or more in their own exports. Claiming other firm\\'s exports through such mechanism would mean that the country\\'s export turnover would remain constant while applicant firm\\'s turnover will skyrocket.\\nExport of rough diamonds even though India is not a rough diamond producing country. These exports stopped the moment DFCE benefits were disallowed.\\nFew firms who exported Gold medallion and studded jewellery indulged in the most notorious misuse of the Policy. Key firms included M/s. Kanak Exports, M/s. Rajesh Exports Overseas and M/s. Adani Exports Limited. According to DRI reports many of these exporters exported to their own counterparts in Dubai and Sharjah. Since the jewellery attracted 5% import duty at Dubai, the consignments which were declared as jewellery in India were declared as scrap in Dubai to avoid the import duty. Since these companies were producing shoddy products in a 12 hour operation, it was difficult for them to achieve the value addition prescribed by the Policy through craftsmanship and hence they added extra gold to get the value addition. However, in this process strangely enough per unit price of the gold exported was less than per unit price of gold imported. Government has secured key documents from UAE Customs.\\nCut and polished diamonds were imported, stored inside a bond and re-exported with artificial value addition. Few large firms led by M/s. Adani Exports Ltd. exported these products to buyers related to them. According to one estimate the same set of diamonds were rotating and these never entered the Indian domestic territory or to the end consumers abroad. The value of such exports in the year 2003-04 and 2004-05 may exceed Rs. 15,000 crores. This report contains observations of DRI, which describes the modus operandi and the firms involved in graphic details.\\nDETAILS OF THE MISUSE OF DUTY FREE CREDIT ENTITLEMENT (DFCE) & TARGET PLUS SCHEME BY THE PETITIONERS\\nBackground of Policy changes\\nIntent of the Government has been to accelerate India\\'s exports and towards this intent DFCE scheme was launched. The scheme envisaged rewarding genuine export growth with the specific objective of accelerating the incremental growth in exports and to facilitate India emerging as a major base for different source of products and services for the rest of the world.\\nThe reward was supposed to motivate and spur exporters in increasing their export turnover. However, the scheme could not have envisaged at the time of its launch that certain exporters would employ non-commercial and unlawful tactics in a manner that would be injurious to the revenue interest and to derive undeserved benefits without actually having positive effect on the overall export effort of the country.\\nDGFT started getting the reports of misuse of the Scheme predominantly on account of buying of exports from the parties who would otherwise not be eligible under the Scheme. To plug the misuse and also to provide clarification on the details of the Scheme, Notification 28 and Public Notice 40 were issued on 28.1.2004.\\nI-Purchase of exports\\nOne of the major misuses reported was that many Status holders were entering into contracts with various exporters for arrangements showing themselves as third party exporters. Such contracts were executed on stamp paper. Ostensibly such status holders indicated themselves as third party exporters helping the other party in obtaining export orders, production of goods as per international standards etc. This legal contract has been entered merely as paper arrangement so as to claim the benefit of duty free import entitlement on the export of others. M/s. Adani Exports Limited was one of the parties in many such contracts.\\nAccording to the Department of Revenue Status Holders were purchasing exports made by other parties at a premium with a view to show incremental growth of 25% or more in exports without having actually achieved such growth.\\n973 crores worth of exports of M/s. Adani Exports Limited came from the supplies from large exporters (status holders). Status holders are large sized exporters who export their goods directly. In this case the benefits of DFEC Scheme were not applicable to all status holders but only to those status holders who were meeting the incremental growth and turnover criteria. It is anybody guess that if the status holders were not meeting the growth criteria they would not have got any benefit under the Scheme. The Petitioners channeled such supplies to gain benefit under the Scheme.\\nClaiming other firm\\'s exports through such mechanism would mean that the country\\'s export turnover would remain constant while applicant firm\\'s turnover will skyrocket. If the firm had focused on increasing their exports, both the firm and the country would have gained in terms of export turnover, however, the firms chose to focus on people who were already exporting (but were not entitled for this benefit). Thus, the firm\\'s turnover in the past year grew at astronomical rate whereas country\\'s export growth was just average.\\nThe Government has, thus, demonstrated that based on the aforesaid exercise undertaken, Notification dated January 28, 2004 as well as Public Notice of the even date were issued.\\n75. Notwithstanding strenuous efforts made by learned Counsel for the wit Petitioners to show that the exports by them were genuine and there was no misuse, we have no hesitation in accepting the plea of the Union that the purport behind Notifications was bona fide which was actuated with the conditions of public interest in mind. We answer the question in the affirmative.\\n76. Let us now discuss the validity of the Notification dated January 28, 2004. The issue that arises for determination is as to:\\nWhether Notification No. 28 dated January 28, 2004 vide which Notes 1 to 5 to para 3.7.2.1 were inserted in the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 was only clarificatory in nature or it amounted to amendment of the provisions of para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy?\\n77. In order to discuss this question in proper perspective, it would be necessary to take note of those portions of the provisions contained in the original Scheme which are relevant for our purposes. Here, we are concerned with para 3.7.2.1 of the Scheme, which we reproduce again for ready reference:\\n3.7.2.1 The status holders shall be eligible for the following new/special facilities:\\n(i) Licence/certificate/permissions and Customs clearances for both imports and exports on self-declaration basis;\\n(ii) Fixation of Input-Output norms on priority within 60 days;\\n(iii) Exemption from compulsory negotiation of documents through banks. The remittance, however, would continue to be received through banking channels;\\n(iv) 100% retention of foreign exchange in EEFC account;\\n(v) Enhancement in normal repatriation period from 180 days to 360 days;\\n(vi) Duty free import entitlement for status holders having incremental growth of more than 25% in FOB value of exports (in free foreign exchange) subject to a minimum export turnover of Rs. 25 crore (in free foreign exchange). The duty free entitlement shall be 10% of the incremental growth in exports. Such entitlement can be used for import of capital goods, office equipment and inputs for their own factory or the factory of the associate/supporting manufacturer/job worker. The entitlement/goods shall not be transferable.\\n78. Vide Notification dated January 28, 2004, 5 Notes were added to the aforesaid para. We are concerned with Note 1 which contained 8 sub-notes, and it reads as under:\\nNote 1 - For the purpose of calculating the value of exports, the following exports shall not be taken into account, namely:\\n(i) re-export of imported goods or exports made through transshipment;\\n(ii) export turnover of units operating under SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STPI Schemes or products manufactured by them and exported through DTA units;\\n(iii) deemed exports (even when payments are received in Free Foreign Exchange) and payment from EEFC account;\\n(iv) service exports;\\n(v) supplies made by one status holder to another status holder;\\n(vi) export performance made by one status holder on behalf of other status holder will not be eligible for entitlement under the scheme;\\n(vii) Supplies made or export performance effected by a non-status holder (Merchant exporter/Manufacturer with any export performance in 2003-2004) to a status holder if the applicant as well as the non status holder have less than 25 per cent incremental growth over their respective previous years direct export turnover;\\n(viii) the exports made by an applicant within a group and the group to which it belongs has individually less than 25 per cent incremental growth of export.\\n79. There was no serious challenge to sub-notes (i), (iii), (iv) and (viii). Before we discuss the effect and impact of the aforesaid sub-notes of Note 1, let us find out as to how the Bombay High Court and Gujarat High Court in their respective judgments have dealt with this issue.\\n80. So far as the Bombay High Court is concerned, after specifically posing the question as to whether Notification dated January 28, 2004 has the effect of introducing a new condition or term or it is merely in the nature of clarification to the existing policy. The High Court referred to the basic objective of the scheme as contained in Commerce and Industry Minister\\'s speech on introducing new EXIM Policy 2002-2007. It reads as under:\\nWe recognize that the status holders will continue to play a significant and increasing role in boosting exports, particularly from the small scale sector, as most of the small scale units will not be in a position to directly access the international markets. Moreover, it will be our endeavor to facilitate India emerging as a major base for out sourcing products and services for the rest of the world. They are also critical to our strategy for accelerating the rate of incremental growth of export. Therefore, we intend to give a premium to the status holders who achieve high growth rate in their exports. It is proposed to give a duty free entitlement to them for import of capital goods, spares, office equipments and consumables. This will be available to status holders who achieve a growth rate of 25% or more in the current year with a minimum export performance of Rs. 25 crores. They would be entitled to a duty free entitlement of 10% of the incremental growth in exports during the current financial year. This entitlement would be subject to actual user condition which can be passed on to associate manufactures.\\n81. The High Court thereafter pointed out that after the aforesaid Scheme was initiated, the Central Government learnt, on the basis of intelligence gathered, that there was a rampant misuse of the scheme by entering into contacts with various exporters showing themselves as third party exporters. These contracts were executed on stamp papers ostensibly showing such status holders as third party exporters helping other parties in obtaining the orders. It was found that these were merely paper arrangement with a view to claim benefits of duty free credit entitlement on the export of others. Insofar as case of writ Petitioner Kanak Exports is concerned, the High Court noticed that in the year 2002-2003, the export of this Petitioner was hardly Rs. 27 crores which took a big leap and quantum jump in the year 2003-2004 when the exports of this Petitioner catapulted to more than Rs. 1000 crores. The national export growth rate was only 22% over the last year whereas exports of Kanak Exports grew at more than 3800%. According to the High Court, it was merely a paper growth and not incremental growth within the meaning of the scheme and the scheme was not to encourage the status holder/export house to pool the exports made by other exporters for the purpose of showing incremental growth. On that basis, the High Court held that the Notification dated January 28, 2004 was merely clarificatory and cannot be treated as amendment to the scheme and backed this conclusion with the following reasons:\\n...However, the basic intention of the amended scheme was to encourage the export of products manufactured by small scale units who do not have access to the international market because of lack of required international marketing expertise and optimum resources to have presence in the international marketing arena. The scheme was not intended to encourage the status holder/export house to pool the exports made by other exporters for the purpose of showing incremental growth in the export. The clarification issued by the impugned Notification in so far as it provides that supplies made by one status holder to another status holder or export performance made by one status holder on behalf of another status holder shall not be eligible for entitlement is in consonance with the basic object of the scheme. The export turnover of the units operating under STZ/EOU/EHTP schemes was also excluded as these units are getting all facilities for import without payment of duty on various types of goods including capital goods required by them for their activities. The intention of the makers of the scheme was not to confer double benefit under para 3.7.2.1. Further an exporter is required to export himself and not benefit from export capabilities of STZ/EOU/EHTP etc. This would be only paper growth and amount to abuse of scheme. Reliance placed by the Petitioners on Circular No. 16 dated 24th December 2002 is also of no assistance as the said Circular stating that 3rd party exports are eligible for all the export promotion schemes was issued long before the special incentive scheme was announced on 31st March 2003. In our opinion, the provisions contained in the impugned Notification dated 28th January 2004 are merely clarificatory and cannot be treated as amendment to the scheme.\\n82. The Gujarat High Court, likewise, had come to the same conclusion in the writ petition of Adani Exports Limited. In fact, paras 17 and 18 of the judgment of the Gujarat High Court is reproduced by the Bombay High Court in its judgment which reflects the mind of the Gujarat High Court in coming to the same conclusion. These paras read as under:\\n17. Under the policy in force prior to the impugned notifications and even thereafter the third party exports are permitted. What was legal earlier is not made illegal at all. For instance, exports of goods manufactured by units in EOU/SEZ zones through status holder are not prohibited but such exports even made between 1.4.2003 and 27.1.2004 are excluded because the benefit of duty free import was already availed for the export of such goods. Chapter 6 of the EXIM policy relates to Export Oriented Units (EOUs). Electronics Hardware Technology Parks (EHTPs), and Software Technology Parks (STPs). As provided in paras 6.1 and 6.8 of the EXIM Policy, these units undertake to export their entire production of goods and services, except permissible sales in the Domestic Tariff Area as per the EXIM Policy. Para 6.2(b) of the EXIM policy provides that \"an EOU/EHTP/STP unit may import without payment of duty all types of goods, including capital goods, as defined in the policy, required by it for its activities as mentioned in para 6.1...\" Para 6.10 reads as under:\\n6.10 As EOU/EHTP/STP unit may export goods manufactured/software developed by it through a merchant export/status holder recognized under this policy any other EOU/EHTP/SEZ unit.\\nThe amendments do not impinge upon the right of any party to export its goods in accordance with the EXIM policy. The clarification only excludes exports which were never intended in the first place to be covered by the Special Scheme under consideration.\\n18. Secondly, the misuse of the scheme by mere paper growth in exports is not to be countenanced. Hence, it is but natural that the notification dated 28.1.2004 would apply to the exports made from 1.4.2003 onwards. In so far as this Court holds that the Notes 1 and 2 read with Note 4 introduced by the notification dated 28.1.2004 are merely clarificatory, the exports made by the Petitioners between 1.4.2003 and 27.1.2003 would certainly be covered by the said notes. Two views are possible about the expression \"incremental growth in exports by 25%\" and the Government adopted the interpretation as reflected in the notification dated 28.1.2004 which is quite in consonance with the object of the Act, EXIM policy and the incentive scheme rather than the interpretation canvassed by the Petitioner. Hence, there is no substance in the challenge to a Notes 1 and 2 read with note 4.\\n83. Sub-note (ii) of Note 1 now provides that export turnover of units pertaining to SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STP or products manufactured by them and exported through DTA units are not to be included and taken into account for the purpose of calculating the value of exports. Both the High Courts in the impugned judgments have held it to be clarificatory on the ground that such export turnover was excluded as these units, namely, those pertaining to SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STP schemes are getting all facilities for import without payment of duty on various types of goods including capital goods required by them for their activities and there was no intention in the original scheme also to confer double benefit under para 3.7.2.1. This question by the writ Petitioners by referring to paras 6.10, 7.1 and 7.8 of the EXIM Policy which permitted, inter alia, export through status holders. On that basis, it was argued by the learned Counsel appearing for these writ Petitioners that sub-note (ii) of Note 1 which stipulated that such exports would not be counted for the purpose of entitlement was not clarificatory but an amendment to the scheme. It is difficult to accept the aforesaid submission. No doubt, such EOU/EHTP/STP schemes are allowed to export goods manufactured by them through a merchant exporter/status holder recognised under the EXIM Policy. Likewise, SEZ is also authorised to export its goods through a status holder. The permission to make exports through status holder is one thing. Taking into account these exports by the status holders for the purpose of calculating the value of exports for availing the benefits of the entitlement given under the scheme is altogether different thing. The counsel for the Petitioners could not refute or deny that such SEZ/EOU//EHTP/STP are getting the benefit of the exports made by them in the form of facilities for import without payment of duty on various types of goods including capital goods required by them for their activities. Therefore, exactly the same benefit which is sought to be given to the status holders for achieving incremental growth as provided in the scheme was already conferred upon. Obviously, purpose of the scheme was not to give double benefit for same exports. In fact, if that is allowed, it would be a clear case of misuse of the scheme inasmuch as for the same export turnover units operating under SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STP would get the certain incentives and the status holders also manage to extract the same benefits exploiting the scheme by exporting the goods manufactured by these STZ/EOU etc. On considering the issue in this hue, we agree with the opinion of the High Court that such a sub-note (ii) was merely clarificatory in nature.\\n84. Sub-note (v) to Note 1 stipulates that if the supply were made by one status holder to another status holder, these shall also be excluded while calculating the value of exports. Likewise, sub-note (vi) of Note 1 excludes the export performance made by one status holder on behalf of other status holder. High Courts have treated it as clarificatory on the ground that the Scheme was not intended to encourage the status holders/export house to pool the exports made by other exporters for the purpose of showing incremental growth in the exports and, therefore, the addition of sub-note (v) to Note 1 was in consonance with the basic objective of the scheme as originally envisaged. Having regard to the nature of this sub-note (v) and when we keep in mind the fact that the two status-holders if they carry out the exports and made the target as per the Scheme were entitled to the benefit of the Scheme, we agree with the High Courts that even insertion of these clauses is clarificatory in nature inasmuch as it only states that the supply made by one status-holder to another status-holder will not be counted. This clarification was issued, as rightly pointed out by the High Courts, to ensure that two status-holders belonging to the same group may not start pooling and try to take undue advantage.\\n85. Insofar as sub-note (vii) of Note 1 is concerned, it stipulates that supplies made or export performance affected by a non status holder to a status holder will not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the value of exports, if the applicant as well as the non status holder have less than 25% incremental growth over their respective previous years. This appears to be clearly clarificatory in nature inasmuch as the purpose of the Scheme was to give benefit to those who are able to achieve incremental growth of 25%. Thus, each such status holder has to independently attain the growth target stipulated in the scheme to avail the benefit. Obviously, if it has not been able to achieve 25% incremental growth, such export house cannot take the advantage by including exports of a non status holders to show that it has achieved 25% incremental growth.\\nAforesaid discussion leads us to conclude that the Notification dated January 28, 2004 was clarificatory in nature and its validity stands upheld.\\n86. Next issue relates to the validity of the Public Notice dated January 28, 2004. The question that is posed for determination on this issue is as to:\\nWhether Public Notice dated January 28, 2004, issued by the DGFT, which sought to exclude the export performance related to class of goods, is without jurisdiction?\\n87. The main submission of the Petitioners, which was before the High Courts as well and reiterated before us, was that Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 seeks to amend the EXIM Policy and DGFT does not have any such power inasmuch as this EXIM Policy is statutory which is issued Under Section 5 of the Act by the Central Government and, therefore, it is only the Central Government which has the power to make amendments to the EXIM Policy. Therefore, the Public Notice issued by DGFT dated January 28, 2004 was without jurisdiction. An additional ground of retrospectivity was also taken to challenge the Public Notice. It was also argued that DGFT by the said Public Notice was seeking to impose additional conditions, not forming part of the original policy which was again impermissible.\\n88. Mr. Adhyaru, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Union of India, on the other hand, submitted that the paramount consideration in issuing the Public Notice was to check unscrupulous exporters including the writ Petitioners for inflating their export turnover by adopting dubious methods. He emphasized the rational for inclusion of four items by this Public Notice which has already been taken note of. His endeavour was to demonstrate that issuance of the Public Notice in question became paramount to cluck unscrupulous methodology adopted by certain exporters with the objective to wrongfully acquire the benefits of the Schemes that could not be countenanced and had to be checked. We are not delving with those alleged malpractices and hold back the same at this juncture. They will be spelled out while discussing the validity of the Notification dated April 21, 2004 as the subject matter thereof is same. Here, we are concerned with the powers of DGFT to issue such a Public Notice.\\n89. In order to answer this question, we have to first determine as to whether this Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 is only an amendment to Handbook of Procedure or it tinkers with the EXIM Policy. To answer this question, we may first go into the Scheme of the Act. For this purpose, Section 5 as well as Section 6 of the Act are to be taken note of in the first instance and read as under:\\n5. Foreign Trade Policy.-The Central Government may, from time to time, formulate and announce, by notification in the Official Gazette, the foreign trade policy and may also, in like manner, amend that policy:\\nProvided that the Central Government may direct that, in respect of the Special Economic Zones, the foreign trade policy shall apply to the goods, services and technology with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations, as may be specified by it by notification in the Official Gazette.]\\n6. Appointment of Director General and his functions.-(1) The Central Government may appoint any person to be the Director-General of Foreign Trade for the purposes of this Act.\\n(2) The Director-General shall advise the Central Government in the formulation of the [foreign trade policy] and shall be responsible for carrying out that policy.\\n(3) The Central Government may, by Order published in the Official Gazette, direct that any power exercisable by it under this Act (other than the powers Under Sections 3, 5, 15, 16 and 19) may also be exercised, in such cases and subject to such conditions, by the Director-General or such other officer subordinate to the Director General, as may be specified in the Order.\\n90. From the aforesaid, it is clear that Section 5 provides that the Central Government may, from time to time, formulate and announce, the EXIM Policy. This has to be done by issuing/announcing this Policy by way of notification in the Official Gazette. The Central Government also has the power to amend the Policy so announced by adopting the same procedure i.e. by issuing notification in the Official Gazette. It is not in dispute that EXIM Policy in question was issued by notification in exercise of powers conferred Under Section 5 of the Act. This Policy, thus, is infested with statutory flavour.\\n91. For the purpose of carrying out the objectives of the Act which includes implementation of the Policy, Central Government is authorised to appoint DGFT as per Section 6 of the Act. Main functions of the DGFT are advising the Central Government in formulation of the Policy and he is also responsible for carrying out the said Policy. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 provides that Central Government may delegate its power exercisable under the Act. However, powers Under Sections 3, 5, 15, 16 and 19 are specifically excluded which means these powers cannot be delegated. Thus, power to announce the Policy and to amend the same remains with the Central Government. Likewise, power to make rules Under Section 19 which vests with the Central Government, cannot be delegated.\\n92. Keeping in mind the aforesaid legal position, we reproduce certain portion of the EXIM Policy announced vide Notification No. 1 dated March 31, 2003 which have bearing on the issue at hand. These are:\\nPara 1.1 of the Export and Import Policy provided that:\\nIn exercise of the powers conferred Under Section 5 of The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation Act), 1992 (No. 22 of 1992), the Central Government hereby notifies the Export and Import Policy for the period 2002-2007. This Policy shall come into force with effect from April 01, 2002 and shall remain in force upto March 31, 2007 and will be co-terminus with the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007).\\nHowever, the Central Government reserves the right in public interest to make any amendments to this Policy in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5 of the Act. Such amendment shall be made means of a Notification published in the Gazette of India.\\nPara 1.2 of the said Policy provides that:\\nAny Notifications made or Public Notices issued or anything done under the previous Export/Import Policies, and in force immediately before the commencement of this Policy shall, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Policy, continue to be in force and shall be deemed to have been made, issued or done under this Policy. License/Certificate/Permissions issued before the commencement of this Policy shall continue to be valid for the purpose for which such licence/Certificate/permission was issued unless otherwise stipulated.\\nPara 2.4 of the Import and Export Policy dealing with the Procedure provides that:\\nThe Director General of Foreign Trade may, in any case or class of cases, specify the procedure to be followed by an exporter or importer or by any licensing or any other competent authority for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act, the Rules and the Order made thereunder and this Policy. Such procedures shall be included in the Handbook (Vol. 1), Handbook (Vol. 2), Schedule of DEPB Rate and in ITC (HS) and published by means of a Public Notice. Such procedures may, in like manner, be amended from time to time.\\nThe Handbook (Vol. 1) is a supplement to the EXIM Policy and contains relevant procedures and other details. The procedure of availing benefits under various schemes of the Policy are given in the Handbook (Vol. 1).\\n93. It is explained by the learned Counsel for the Union of India that a Notification issued Under Section 5 of the Act or any change brought about by the DGFT in exercise of the powers under Para 2.4 of the Import and Export Policy in the Handbook Procedure, by way of a Public Notice the same are Gazetted and Notified in the Gazette of India. It is also pointed out that the Notification/Public Notices issued relating to Non-Statutory Rules, Regulations, Order and Resolutions issued by the Ministries of Government of India, (other than the Defence Ministry) and by the Supreme Court of India are published under Part 1 Section 1 of the Gazette of India. On the other hand, Notifications issued by the Ministries of Government of India (other than the Defence Ministry) are published under Part 2 Section 3 and Sub-Section 2 of the Gazette of India. On that basis, justification is sought to be given that the Notification No. 28(RE-2003)/2002-2007 dated January 28, 2004, Notification No. 38/(RE-2003) 2002-2007 dated April 21, 2004 were published in the Gazette of India under Part 2 and 3(II), while Public Notice No. 40 dated January 28, 2004 was published in the Gazette of India under Part 1 Section 1 of the Gazette of India and as such, as both the Notifications as well as the Public Notices are officially gazetted in the Gazette of India. Thus, there is no distinction between the two as the same carry the same impact and effect.\\n94. From the aforesaid explanation, we take it that the Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 was published in the Gazette of India in accordance with the requirement of law. The question, however, is as to whether by this Public Notice, DGFT was only carrying out the EXIM Policy or this Public Notice amounted to change in the said EXIM Policy. It is crystal clear that the Public Notice alters the provisions of EXIM Policy. It would, therefore, amount to amending the EXIM Policy, whether clarificatory or otherwise. There may be a valid justification and rational for exclusion of four items contained therein, as pleaded by the Union. However, it had to be done in accordance with law. When the DGFT had no power in this behalf, he could not have excluded such items from the purview of EXIM Policy by means of Public Notice. The power of DGFT is only to be exercised for procedural purposes and both the High Courts have rightly remarked that para 3.2.6 inserted by public notice goes beyond the procedural conditions.\\n95. In fact, the Government itself realised the same, namely, the DGFT had no such power. It is for this reason that what was sought to be achieved by the said Public Notice, was formalised by the Central Government by issuing Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004 in exercise of powers conferred on the Central Government by Section 5 of the Act and the same four items were excluded.\\n96. Therefore, we hold that public notice dated January 28, 2004 issued by DGFT, so far it excludes the aforesaid four items, is ultra vires.\\n97. Now, we advert to the issue pertaining to Notification dated April 28, 2004. The question here is as to:\\nWhether subsequent Notification dated April 21, 2004, read with Notification dated April 28, 2004, seeking to exclude the export performance related to class of goods covered by para 2 of the Public Notice dated April 28, 2004, by way of Notes 6 to para 3.7.2.1 of the EXIM Policy, would relate back to the date of Public Notice dated January 28, 2004 or is to be given prospective effect from the date of issuance of Notifications on April 21 and 23, 2004.\\n98. It is no doubt that the Central Government has the power to amend the Policy and, therefore, it could do so vide Notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004. The only question is as to whether these Notifications are bad in law on the ground that they seek to apply retrospectively.\\n99. We start with the premise that there was complete justification for excluding the four items insofar as grant of benefit under scheme is concerned. The Union of India has been able to demonstrate the same in full measure. This aspect has already been discussed in detail at the outset itself.\\n100. However, at the same time, as already been pointed out above, this Notification is not clarificatory in nature unlike Notification dated January 28, 2004. Therefore, the issue of retrospectivity becomes important. The contention of Mr. Adhyaru is that the Notification is not retrospective but retroactive in nature. In the alternative, it is submitted that even it is treated as retrospective, the Government has right to do so under the given circumstances inasmuch as grant of concession or incentive is the privilege of the Central Government which can always be withdrawn and in the present case, it is withdrawn for justifiable reasons and in public interest which is the paramount consideration and over rights all private considerations. Therefore, it is argued, the question of retrospectivity of Policy by the impugned Notification does not arise at all. Mr. Adhyaru also argued that there was an implied power vested with the Central Government to amend the Policy retrospectively.\\n101. We may state, at the outset, that the incentive scheme in question, as promulgated by the Government, is in the nature of concession or incentive which is a privilege of the Central Government. It is for the Government to take the decision to grant such a privilege or not. It is also trite law that such exemptions, concessions or incentives can be withdrawn any time. All these are matters which are in the domain of policy decisions of the Government. When there is withdrawal of such incentive and it is also shown that the same was done in public interest, the Court would not tinker with these policy decisions. This is so laid down by catena of judgments of this Court and is now treated as established and well grounded principle of law. In such circumstances, even the Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel cannot be ignored.\\n102. We may suitably refer to the judgment of this Court in \\nKasinka Trading and another, etc. etc. Vs. Union of India and another, \\n. In that case, Government of India had issued Notification Under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1962 in \\'public interest\\' granting exemption from whole of the customs duty on import of PVC resin. This Notification was to remain in force till March 31, 1981. However, even before the said date, by another Notification dated October 16, 1980, the full exemption from custom duty was withdrawn and it was reduced to the exemption from custom duty as is in excess of 40% ad valorem. The importer had contended that relying on the exemption notification dated March 15, 1979, it had placed orders for the import of PVC resins on the understanding that the commodity was totally exempt from customs duty, the Government must be held bound by the representations contained in the notification dated March 15, 1979 and the Government was estopped on the basis of promissory estoppel to go back on its promise. The Government justified the withdrawal of exemption on the ground that the Government had issued notification dated March 15, 1979 with a view to equalizing sale prices of the indigenous and the imported material and to make the commodity available to the consumer at a uniform price, keeping in view the trends in the supply of the material. Subsequently, it was realized that the international prices of the product were falling and consequently the import prices had become lower than the ex-factory prices of the indigenous material. Hence, it was decided in \"public interest\" to withdraw the exemption notification.\\nThis Court held that, \"the reasons given by the Union of India justifying withdrawal of the exemption notification, in our opinion, are not irrelevant to the exercise of the power in public interest nor are the same shown to be insufficient to support the exercise of that power\". The Court also observed that, the power to grant exemption from payment of duty flows from the provisions of Section 25(1) of the Customs Act. The power to exempt includes the power to modify or withdraw the same. Such an exemption by its very nature is susceptible of being revoked or modified or subjected to other conditions. The supersession or revocation of an exemption notification in the public interest is an exercise of the statutory power of the State under the law itself as is obvious not merely from the language of Section 25 of the act, but also from the General Clauses Act under which the authority which has the power to issue a notification has the undoubted power to rescind or modify the notification in the like manner. The Court also examined the case of the Appellant-Petitioners that relying upon the notification dated March 15, 1979, they had acted and the Government could not be permitted to go back on its assurance otherwise they would be put to huge loss. The Court dealt with this contention in the following words:\\nThe Courts have to balance equities between the parties and indeed the Courts would bind the Government by its promise to prevent manifest injustice or fraud.\\nThe Court also quoted with approval the following observations from Malhotra and Sons v. Union of India AIR 1976 J and K 41:\\nThe Courts will only bind the Government by its promises to prevent manifest injustice or fraud and will not make the Government a slave of its policy for all times to come when the Government acts in its Governmental, public or sovereign capacity.\\n103. The above decision was followed by this Court in Shrijee Sales Corporation v. Union of India (1999) 3 SCC 398 where also the same notifications were considered. In that case also, the Appellants-Petitioners had alleged that they would not have imported the PVC resin without the exemption as that would have been unviable and uneconomical and further that many persons took full advantage of the exemption. The Court held that the facts of the economic situation explained in the judgment rendered in Kasinka Trading\\'s case were not contravened nor was it alleged that public interest did not call for supersession of the exemption notification. The Court also examined the question whether the fact that the notification dated 15.03.1979 mentioned the period during which it was to remain in force would make any difference to the situation. The Court then held that-\\'once public interest is accepted as the superior equity which can override individual equity, the principles should be applicable even in cases where a period has been indicated\\'.\\n104. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the Government has a right to amend, modify or even rescind a particular Scheme. It is well settled that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore its validity cannot be tested on any rigid prior considerations or on the application of any straight-jacket formula. In Balco Employees Union (regd.) v. Union of India and Ors. (2000) 2 SCC 333, the Supreme Court held that Laws, including executive action relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc., that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrine or straightjacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where having regard to the nature of the problems greater latitude require to be allowed to the legislature. The question, however, is as to whether it can be done retrospectively, thereby taking away some right that had accrued in favour of another person?\\n105. The case of the exporters is that by achieving the target contained in the Scheme in respect of incremental exports, these exporters had right accrued in their favour to claim the benefits provided for achieving this target. It was submitted in this behalf that the Scheme came into force w.e.f. April 01, 2003 and from April 01, 2003 to March 31, 2004 i.e. during these 12 months, the status holders were entitled to make the exports and once the targets as set out in the Clause 3.2.7.1 (vi) were achieved, the exporters became entitled to get duty free import to the extent of 10% of the incremental growth in exports. According to them, the moment a particular exporter fulfilled the target of incremental growth of more than 25% of FOB value in exports with minimum export value turnover of 25 crore, said exporter got right to have duty free entitlement equivalent to 10% of incremental growth in exports. The only condition was that this entitlement was to be used w.e.f. April 01, 2004 for import of items specified in the said clause. On that basis, it was argued that the effect of the impugned Notification was to take away this vested right accrued away in their favour and it amount to giving retrospective operation to the said circular which was not permissible. Following judgments were cited in support of the plea that there was no such power to make provision with retrospective effect in exercise of power of delegated legislation:\\n(i) \\nUnion of India (UOI) and Others Vs. Asian Food Industries, \\n.\\n48. The Delhi High Court, however, in our view correctly opined that the Notification dated 4-7-2006 could not have been taken into consideration on the basis of the purported publicity made in the proposed change in the export policy in electronic or print media. Prohibition promulgated by a statutory order in terms of Section 5 read with the relevant provisions of the policy decision in the light of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 1992 Act can only have a prospective effect. By reason of a policy, a vested or accrued right cannot be taken away. Such a right, therefore, cannot a fortiori be taken away by an amendment thereof.\\n(ii) State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Basant Agrotech (India) Ltd. (2013) 15 SCC 1.\\n21. There is no dispute over the fact that the legislature can make a law retrospectively or prospectively subject to justifiability and acceptability within the constitutional parameters. A subordinate legislation can be given retrospective effect if a power in this behalf is contained in the principal Act. In this regard we may refer with profit to the decision in \\nMahabir Vegetable Oils Pvt. Ltd. and Another Vs. State of Haryana and Others, \\n, wherein it has been held that:\\n41. We may at this stage consider the effect of omission of the said note. It is beyond any cavil that a subordinate legislation can be given a retrospective effect and retroactive operation, if any power in this behalf is contained in the main Act. The rule-making power is a species of delegated legislation. A delegatee therefore can make rules only within the four corners thereof.\\n42. It is a fundamental rule of law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by necessary and distinct implication.\\n(iii) Keshavlal Jethalal Shah v. Mohanlal Bhagwandas and Anr. (1968) 3 SCR 623.\\n13. Counsel for the Respondent also submitted that Section 29(2) as amended was intended to have retrospective operation, because the Amending Act was in the nature of explanatory legislation. There is nothing in the language of Section 29(2) as amended, which may indicate that it was intended to be retrospective in operation. Section 29(2) as amended in terms confers jurisdiction upon the High Court to call for the record of a case for the purpose of satisfying itself that the decision in appeal was according to law, which the High Court did not possess before the date of the Amending Act. The amending clause does not seek to explain any pre-existing legislation which was ambiguous or defective. The power of the High Court to entertain a petition for exercising revisional jurisdiction was before the amendment derived from Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure, and the legislature has by the Amending Act attempted to explain the meaning of that provision. An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the previous Act. Section 29(2) before it was enacted, was precise in its implication as well as in its expression: the meaning of the words used was not in doubt, and there was no omission in its phraseology which was required to be supplied by the amendment.\\n(iv) \\nCommissioner of Income Tax Vs. Vatika Township Private Limited, \\n.\\n28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed not to be intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today and in force and not tomorrow\\'s backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature of the law is founded on the bed rock that every human being is entitled to arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law and should not find that his plans have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is known as lex prospicit non respicit: law looks forward not backward. As was observed in Phillips v. Eyre (1870) LR 6 QB 1, a retrospective legislation is contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for the first time to deal with future acts ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.\\n29. The obvious basis of the principle against retrospectivity is the principle of \\'fairness\\', which must be the basis of every legal rule as was observed in the decision reported in L\\'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. (1994) 1 AC 486 Thus, legislations which modified accrued rights or which impose obligations or impose new duties or attach a new disability have to be treated as prospective unless the legislative intent is clearly to give the enactment a retrospective effect; unless the legislation is for purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a former legislation or to explain a former legislation. We need not note the cornucopia of case law available on the subject because aforesaid legal position clearly emerges from the various decisions and this legal position was conceded by the counsel for the parties. In any case, we shall refer to few judgments containing this dicta, a little later.\\nxxx\\n33. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Keshavlal Jethalal Shah v. Mohanlal Bhagwandas and Anr. (1968) 3 SCR 623, while considering the nature of amendment to Section 29(2) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act as amended by Gujarat Act 18 of 1965, observed as follows:\\nThe amending clause does not seek to explain any pre-existing legislation which was ambiguous or defective. The power of the High Court to entertain a petition for exercising revisional jurisdiction was before the amendment derived from Section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, and the legislature has by the amending Act attempted to explain the meaning of that provision. An explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the previous Act.\\n(v) \\nTrimbak Damodhar Raipurkar Vs. Assaram Hiraman Patil and Others, \\n.\\n8. Besides, it is necessary to bear in mind that the right of the Appellant to eject the Respondents would arise only on the termination of the tenancy, and in the present case it would have been available to him on March 31, 1953 if the statutory provision had not in the meanwhile extended the life of the tenancy. It is true that the Appellant gave notice to the Respondents on March 11, 1952 as he was then no doubt entitled to do; but his right as a landlord to obtain possession did not accrue merely on the giving of the notice, it accrued in his favour on the date when the lease expired. It is only after the period specified in the notice is over and the tenancy has in fact expired that the landlord gets a right to eject the tenant and obtain possession of the land. Considered from this point of view, before the right accrued to the Appellant to eject the Respondents amending Act 33 of 1952 stepped in and deprived him of that right by requiring him to comply with the statutory requirement as to a valid notice which has to be given for ejecting tenants.\\n9. In this connection it is relevant to distinguish between an existing right and a vested right. Where a statute operates in future it cannot be said to be retrospective merely because within the sweep of its operation all existing rights are included. As observed by Buckley, L.J. in West v. Gwynne retrospective operation is one matter and interference with existing rights is another. \"If an Act provides that as at a past date the law shall be taken to have been that which it was not, that Act I understand to be retrospective. That is not this case. The question here is whether a certain provision as to the contents of leases is addressed to the case of all leases or only of some, namely, leases executed after the passing of the Act. The question is as to the ambit and scope of the Act, and not as to the date as from which the new law, as enacted by the Act, is to be taken to have been the law.\" These observations were made in dealing with the question as to the retrospective construction of Section 3 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1892 (55 & 56 Vict. c. 13). In substance Section 3 provided that in all leases containing a covenant, condition or agreement against assigning, underletting, or parting with the possession, or disposing of the land or property leased without licence or consent, such covenant, condition or agreement shall, unless the lease contains an expressed provision to the contrary, be deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine shall be payable for or in respect of such licence or consent. It was held that the provisions of the said section applied to all leases whether executed before or after the commencement of the Act; and, according to Buckley, L.J., this construction did not make the Act retrospective in operation; it merely affected in future existing rights under all leases whether executed before or after the date of the Act. The position in regard to the operation of Section 5(1) of the amending Act with which we are concerned appears to us to be substantially similar.\\n10. A similar question had been raised for the decision of this Court in Jivabhai Purshottam v. Chhagan Karson Civil Appeal No. 153 of 1958 decided on 27-3-1961 in regard to the retrospective operation of Section 34(2)(a) of the said amending Act 33 of 1952 and this Court has approved of the decision of the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court on that point in Durlabbhai Fakirbhai v. Jhaverbhai Bhikabhai (1956) 58 BLR 85. It was held in Durlabbhai case that the relevant provision of the amending Act would apply to all proceedings where the period of notice had expired after the amending Act had come into force and that the effect of the amending Act was no more than this that it imposed a new and additional limitation on the right of the landlord to obtain possession from his tenant. It was observed in that judgment that \"a notice Under Section 34(1) is merely a declaration to the tenant of the intention of the landlord to terminate the tenancy; but it is always open to the landlord not to carry out his intention. Therefore, for the application of the restriction Under Sub-Section 2(a) on the right of the landlord to terminate the tenancy, the crucial date is not the date of notice but the date on which the right to terminate matures; that is the date on which the tenancy stands terminated.\\n(vi) \\nSakuru Vs. Tanaji, \\n\\n4. Our attention was drawn to the fact that subsequent to the decision of the High Court, the State Legislature has enacted the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy Laws (Amendment) Act, 1979 - Act 2 of 1979, whereby Section 93 of the Act has been amended and the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 have now been expressly made applicable to appeals and revisions preferred Under Sections 90 and 91 of the Act. We see no force in the contention advanced on behalf of the Appellant that the said amendment is clarificatory in nature. The provisions of Section 93 as they stood prior to this amendment were free from any ambiguity and called for no clarification. The Legislature has also not given any indication of any intention to clarify but, on the other hand, what has been done by it is to amend the section with only prospective effect. The amended provisions of Section 93 are, therefore, of no assistance to the Appellant in this case which is governed by the section as it was originally enacted.\\n(vii) \\nUnion of India (UOI) and Others Vs. N.R. Parmar and Others etc. etc., \\n.\\n35. Having examined the matter thus far, it is necessary to refer to the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue\\'s Letter dated 11-5-2004 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Letter dated 11-5-2004\"). The aforesaid letter is being reproduced below:\\n\\nNew Delhi, 11-5-2004\\nTo,\\nThe Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (CCA), Chandigarh\\nSubject: Fixation of inter se seniority of DR and promotee Income Tax Inspectors in view of clarification given by DoP & T in r/o OM dated 3-7-1986\\nSir,\\nI am directed to refer to your Letter F. No. CC/CHD/2003-04/935 dated 4-12-2003 on the above subject and to say that the matter has been examined in consultation with DoP & T and necessary clarification in the mater is given as under:\\n3. The representations may please be disposed of accordingly.\\nYours faithfully,sd/- Under-Secretary to the Government of India\\n36. A perusal of the Letter dated 11-5-2004 reveals that it adopts a position in clear conflict with the one expressed in the OMs dated 7-2-1986 and 3-7-1986, as well as, in the OMs dated 20-12-1999 and 2-2-2000. In the aforesaid Letter dated 11-5-2004 it was sought to be \"clarified\", that the seniority of direct recruits vis-à-vis promotees, would be determined with reference to the year in which the direct recruits are appointed. And further, that direct recruits cannot claim seniority with reference to the year in which the vacancies against which they are appointed had arisen. In our considered view reliance on the Letter dated 11-5-2004, for the determination of the present controversy, is liable to outright rejection. This is so because, the Letter dated 11-5-2004 has been styled as a \"clarification\" (see heading in right hand column). One of the essential ingredients of a clarification is, that it \"clarifies\" an unclear, doubtful, inexplicit or ambiguous aspect of an instrument. A \"clarification\" cannot be in conflict with the instrument sought to be clarified. The Letter dated 11-5-2004 breaches both the essential ingredients of a \"clarification\" referred to above. That apart, the Letter dated 11-5-2004 is liable to be ignored in view of two subsequent Letters of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue dated 27-7-2004 and 8-9-2004.\\n37. The Letter dated 27-7-2004 is reproduced hereunder:\\n\\nNew Delhi, 27-7-2004\\nTo,\\nThe Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (CCA), Chandigarh\\nSubject: Fixation of inter se seniority of DR and promotee Income Tax Inspectors in view of clarification given by DoP & T in r/o OM dated 3-7-1986.\\nSir,\\nI am directed to refer to the Board\\'s letter of even number dated 11-5-2004 on the above subject and to request that the application of this clarification may be kept in abeyance till further orders.\\nYours faithfully,sd/-Under-Secretary to the Government of India\\nA perusal of the Letter dated 27-7-2004 reveals that the allegedly clarificatory Letter dated 11-5-2004 had been kept in abeyance.\\nxxx\\n41. Before examining the merits of the controversy on the basis of the OM dated 3-3-2008, it is necessary to examine one related submission advanced on behalf of the direct recruits. It was the contention of the learned Counsel, that the OM dated 3-3-2008 being an executive order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training, would apply only prospectively. In this behalf it was pointed out, that the disputed seniority between rival parties before this Court was based on the appointment to the cadre of Income Tax Inspectors, well before the OM dated 3-3-2008 was issued. As such, it was pointed out, that the same would not affect the merits of controversy before this Court. We have considered the instant submission. It is not possible for us to accept the aforesaid contention advanced at the hands of the learned Counsel. If the OM dated 3-3-2008 was in the nature of an amendment, there may well have been merit in the submission. The OM dated 3-3-2008 is in the nature of a \"clarification\". Essentially, a clarification does not introduce anything new, to the already existing position. A clarification, only explains the true purport of an existing instrument. As such, a clarification always relates back to the date of the instrument which is sought to be clarified.\\n106. In nutshell, it was submitted that once there is a vested right and not merely existing right, taking away that right amounts to giving retrospective effect to the Notification which was impermissible. In the same breath, it was argued that it cannot be treated as retroactive operation of the Notification.\\n107. Learned senior Counsel appearing for the Revenue, on the other hand, argued that no such right got crystallized in favour of the exporters as entitlement for export was to take effect from April 01, 2004. It was submitted that at the most with achieving of the export targets, they became eligible to avail the benefit of the Scheme but before this benefit could be availed of, for which the effective date was April 01, 2004, impugned Notification was issued on January 28, 2004. On this basis, it was argued that the Notification given only retroactive effect and not retrospective effect.\\n108. We may, in the first instance, make this legal position clear that a delegated or subordinate legislation can only be prospective and not retrospective, unless rule making authority has been vested with power under a statute to make rules with retrospective effect. In the present case, Section 5 of the Act does not give any such power specifically to the Central Government to make rules retrospective. No doubt, this Section confer powers upon the Central Government to \\'amend\\' the policy which has been framed under the aforesaid provisions. However, that by itself would not mean that such a provision empowers the Government to do so retrospective. This legal position is rightly discussed by the Bombay High Court in the impugned judgment in the following words:\\nWe are unable to accept the submissions of learned Additional Solicitor General. The word \"amend\" does not give power to make amendment retrospectively if it is used in relation to the power to make a piece of delegated legislation. The connotation of the word \"amend\" when it is used for the exercise of power by a legislature cannot be pressed to construe the word \"amend\" in relation to the power to make delegated legislation. In this regard the following observations of the Supreme Court in \\nAccountant General and Another Vs. S. Doraiswamy and Others, \\nare pertinent:\\nThe next question is whether Clause (5) of Article 148 permits the enactment of rules having retrospective operation. It is settled law that unless a statute conferring the power to make rules provides for the making of rules with retrospective operation, the rules made pursuant to that power can have prospective operation only. An exception, however, is the proviso to Article 309. In \\nB.S. Vadera Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Others, \\n, this Court held that the rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution could have retrospective operation. The conclusion followed from the circumstance that the power conferred under the proviso to Article 309 was intended to fill a hiatus, that is to say, until Parliament or a State Legislature enacted a law on the subject-matter of Article 309. The rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 were transient in character and were to do duty only until legislation was enacted. As interim substitutes for such legislation it was clearly intended that the rules should have the same range of operation as an Act of Parliament or of the State Legislature. The intent was reinforced by the declaration in the proviso to Article 309 that \"any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act\". Those features are absent in Clause (5) of Article 148. There is nothing in the language of that clause to indicate that the rules framed therein were intended to serve until parliamentary legislation was enacted. All that the clause says is that the rules framed would be subject to the provisions of the Constitution and of any law made by Parliament. We are satisfied that Clause (5) of Article 148 confers power on the President to frame rules operating prospectively only. Clearly then, the Rules of 1974 cannot have retrospective operation, and therefore Sub-rule (2) of Rule 1, which declares that they will be deemed to have come into force on July 27, 1956 must be held ultra vires.\\nThe reliance placed on the power to regulate Under Section 3 of the Act is equally misconceived. Section 5 gives express power to formulate the policy and to amend it. This is specific power. The power to regulate therefore cannot be read as a power to amend when a specific power to amend is given. If the power to regulate does not include the power to amend retrospectively such a power cannot be read into Section 3 of the Act.\\nSection 21 of the General Clauses Act on which reliance is placed by learned Additional Solicitor General is also of no assistance to sustain the retrospective operation of the notification. Section 21 of the General Clauses Act embodies a rule of construction, nature and extent of application of which must inevitably be governed by the relevant provisions of the statute which confers power to issue the notification. The said power must be exercised within the limits prescribed by the provisions conferring the said power. (See \\nGopi Chand Vs. The Delhi Administration, \\n, \\nLachmi Narain and Others Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Others, \\nand \\nState of Kerala and Others Vs. K.G. Madhavan Pillai and Others, \\n. The ratio in H.C. Suman\\'s case also cannot be applied because in that case it was found that Section 88 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, 1972 contained the power to exempt and if the provisions of Section 12 of the said Act were to be exempted the provisions which provided that byelaws are effective from the date of registration. The notification issued Under Section 88 would exempt it and Section 88 would contain the power to exempt retrospectively. Similarly, Section 14 of the General Clauses Act has no application as it merely provides that where any power is conferred on the Government, then that power can be exercised from time to time as occasion requires.\\nUnder that Scheme the status holder is eligible for benefits upon achieving the incremental growth of 25% of the FOB value of exports in the current year over the previous year. It therefore follows that no sooner the status holder achieves 25% incremental growth, the status holder would be entitled to the benefits under the Scheme. Immediately upon attaining the prescribed incremental growth, the status holder becomes eligible to certificate for duty free import and thereby a right vests in the exporter to receive the same.\\n109. So far so good. The effect of the aforesaid discussion would be that if the Status Holders had achieved 25% incremental growth in exports, they acquired the right to receive the benefit under the Scheme, which could not be taken away. The pertinent and crucial question is as to whether these exporters/writ Petitioners acquired any such right? Let us sharpen this question before we answer the same by formulating it in the following words:\\nWhether, in the cases of these exporters, the exports shown by them can be treated as actual exports entitling them to avail the benefit of the Scheme?\\n110. This issue would be inter-twined with other related issue, namely, whether the notification has retroactive operation or it is retrospective in nature. Both these aspects are to be dealt with simultaneously in order to provide suitable and right answer to the question posed. The case of the exporters, as noticed above, is that since they had already fulfilled the requirement of \\'incremental growth in exports\\' which they were require to fulfill between April 01, 2003 to March 31, 2004, a vested right accrued in their favour to get the special incentive in terms of the scheme which, of course, was to be availed from April 01, 2004. The case of the Government, on the other hand, is that the benefit was to accrue to these exporters only from April 01, 2004 and before that it was withdrawn and, thus, no vested right accrued in their favour. It was also argued that in the policy, which provides special incentives to status holder, the term \"incremental growth in export\" was not defined/clarified at the time when the policy was issued. By the impugned notification, the blanks/gaps were filled and the term incremental growth in export was defined and it was clarified as to how the incremental growth in export is to be actually worked out. This was also done before the question of actual working out of the incremental growth in exports arose and hence, no retrospective effect.\\n111. An astute and penetrative examination of the record, with reference to the results of the investigation, which had prompted the Central Government to issue these Notifications, provides a very tidy answer to the question posed above is that the so-called targets achieved were only on paper through fraudulent means and, therefore, it cannot be said that any vested right accrued in favour of these exporters.\\n112. We have referred to such material in detail while upholding the contention of the Union that Notifications were issued in public interest to ensure that their misuse is not allowed. To recapitulate, the inquiry conducted by the Government revealed that there were exports of rough diamonds even though India is not a rough diamond producing country. These exports stopped the moment DFCE benefits in respect of rough diamond were disallowed. It was also found that cut and polished diamonds were imported, stored inside a bond and re-exported with artificial value addition. Many of these exporters exported to their own counterparts in Dubai and Sharjah and when this consignments reached those destinations, they were declared as scrap to avoid import duty. Following statistics given by the Government in respect of so-called exports by these exporters makes out startling revelations:\\nGrowth exceeding 2000% for two Petitioners came from 100% export of gold coins and plain jewellery\\nFor M/s. Adani Exports, over 80% of export turnover came for diamonds and Supplies from status holders not meeting the minimum turnover and growth criteria\\nExport surge of 1135% for M/s. Adani Exports came in 2003-04 while for the past six years their exports were declining.\\npertinent to note that except the above mentioned persons no other exporter in the country has challenged the said Notifications or the Public Notices dated January 28, 2004 and April 21, 2004 respectively.\\nIt was also brought to the notice of the DGFT that some of the exporters have procured rough diamonds from local firms and exported the same by a 5% loss as they were confident of covering up the loss by receiving the 10% DFCE incentives offered by the Government. All these aspects are discussed in much details earlier and need not be repeated. We would like to recapitulate the following stark features/practices which have surfaced on record as a result of investigation:\\n113. Mr. Adhyaru has successfully demonstrated that the following methods were found to be resorted to by these exporters to inflate their export turnovers:\\n(i) Export of rough diamonds even though India is not a rough diamond producing country. These exports stopped the moment DFCE benefits were disallowed.\\nExport of such rough diamonds earlier has never been part of the normal commercial operations and has taken place just to take advantage of the Scheme.\\nAccording to Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, \"India is not a rough exporting country. Rough diamonds which are unsustainable for cutting in India are re-exported.\" Such exports stopped the moment benefit was explicitly withdrawn.\\n(ii) In the present case also the Respondent M/s. Adani Exports Limited had stopped exporting the rough diamonds the moment the Notification was issued in January, 2004 and according to Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, \"Party has not exported rough diamonds during January/March 2004\".\\n(iii) Cut and polished diamonds were imported, stored inside a bond and re-exported with artificial value addition. Few large firms including the Petitioners exported these products to buyers directly related to them.\\n(iv) According to reliable information the same sets of diamonds were rotating and these never entered the Indian domestic territory or to the end consumers abroad. The value of such exports in the past two years may exceed Rs. 15,000 crores. Government has detailed report of the modus operandi of the firms involved.\\n(v) Most notorious misuse of the Scheme was carried out by few firms who exported Gold medallion and studded jewellery. Key firms included M/s. Kanak Exports, M/s. Rajesh Exports Ltd. and M/s. Adani Exports Ltd.\\n(vi) Many of these exporters exported to their own counterparts in Dubai and Sharjah. Since the jewellery attracted 5% import duty at Dubai, the consignments which were declared as jewellery in India were declared as scrap in Dubai to avoid the import duty.\\n(vii) As it was difficult for them to achieve the value addition prescribed by the Policy through craftsmanship, they added extra gold to get the value addition. However, in this process strangely enough per unit price of the gold exported was less than per unit price of gold imported.\\n(viii) Few exporters including Petitioners have purchased exports of other firms to inflate their turnover. Contracts have been signed between the Petitioners and other exporters that Petitioner will provide marketing and other services and act as third party exporter. According to reports status-holders were purchasing exports made by other parties at a premium with a view to show incremental growth of 25% or more in exports without having actually achieved such growth.\\n114. In such a scenario, a sagacious approach with practical sense leads us to conclude that these writ Petitioners/exporters had actually achieved the targets set down in the original Scheme and thereby acquired any \"vested right\". It was pernicious and blatant misuse of the provisions of the Scheme and periscopic viewing thereof establishes the same. Thus, the impugned decision reflected in the notifications dated April 21 and 23, 2004, did not take away any vested right of these exporters and amendments were necessitated by over-whelming public interest/considerations to prevent the misuse of the Scheme.\\nTherefore, we are of the opinion that even when impugned Notification issued Under Section 5 could not be retrospective in nature, such retrospectivity have not deprived the writ Petitioners/exporters of their right inasmuch as no right had accrued in favour of such persons under the Scheme. This Court, or for that matter the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, cannot come to the aid of such Petitioners/exporters who, without making actual exports, play with the provisions of the Scheme and try to take undue advantage thereof. To this extent, direction of the Bombay High Court granting these exporters benefit of the Scheme for the past period is set aside.\\n115. One incidental issue remains to be discussed. This pertains to imposition of fee sought to be levied by Public Notice No. 18 dated July 24, 2003. The exporters are right in their submission that fee could not be imposed by a Public Notice and it was necessary to have recourse to Section 5 of the Act to impose such a fee. Notification dated July 24, 2003 insofar as it relates to imposition of fee is, therefore, set aside.\\n116. Thus, appeals and transfer cases stand disposed of in terms of aforesaid answers provided by this Court to the various questions formulated. To put it precisely, the effect of the aforesaid discussion would be to uphold the decision of the Gujarat High Court, though on different grounds, thereby dismissing the appeals of the exporters against the said judgment except to the extent indicated in para 114 above while the appeals of the Government are allowed. Likewise, appeals of the Union of India against the judgment of the Bombay High Court are allowed to the aforesaid extent and the appeals of the exporters/writ Petitioners are dismissed.\\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 27 of 2008\\nTransfer Case (Civil) No. 32 of 2007\\nTransfer Case (Civil) No. 33 of 2007\\nTransfer Case (Civil) No. of 2015(arising out of Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 568 of 2014)\\n117. For the reasons mentioned in Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 568 of 2014, the same is allowed and LPA No. 290 of 2007, entitled \\'Union of India and Ors. v. Welspun India Limited\\', pending in the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad is transferred to this Court. Since the challenge laid in the case is identical with that involved in the rest of the batch matters, summoning of the records of the case is dispensed with and the matter is heard on the basis of the record already available before the Court.\\n118. In these cases, challenge is to the constitutional validity of para 3.7.8 of the EXIM Policy 2004-2009 as well as Notification No. 48/2005 dated February 20, 2006 and Notification No. 8/2006 dated June 12, 2006 by which certain amendments in the aforesaid EXIM Policy were made. Though it involves a different Scheme, known as \\'Target Plus Scheme\\', since the provisions and amendments are again primarily challenged on the ground that these amendments are given retrospective effect from April 01, 2005, these matters were also analogously heard with the other batch of cases which have already been dealt with above.\\n119. As already noted above, the Government had announced EXIM Policy 2004-2009. In this Policy various schemes and incentives to promote exports were promulgated. One such scheme was known as \\'Target Plus Scheme\\' (TPS) for the aforesaid period of EXIM Policy, i.e. April 2004 to March 2009. This TPS was contained in para 3.7 of the said EXIM Policy and reads as under:\\n3.7 TARGET PLUS SCHEME\\n3.7.1 Objective\\nThe objective of the scheme is to accelerate growth in exports by rewarding Star Export Houses who have achieved a quantum growth in exports. High performing Star Export Houses shall be entitled for a duty credit based on incremental exports, substantially higher than the general annual export target fixed (Since the target fixed for 2005-06 is 17%, the lower limit of performance for qualifying for rewards is pegged at 20% for the current year).\\n3.7.2 Eligibility Criteria\\nAll Star Export Houses (including Status Holders as defined in Para 3.7.2.1 of Exim Policy 2002-07) which have achieved a minimum export turnover in free foreign exchange of Rs. 10 crores in the previous licensing year are eligible for consideration under the Target Plus Scheme.\\n3.7.3 Entitlement\\nThe entitlement under this scheme would be contingent on the percentage incremental growth in FOB value of exports in the current licensing year over the previous licensing year, as under:\\nNote: (1) Incremental growth beyond 100% will not qualify for computation of duty credit entitlement.\\n(2) For the purpose of this scheme, the export performance shall not be transferred to or transferred from any other exporter. In the case of third party exports, the name of the supporting manufacturer/manufacturer exporter shall be declared.\\n(3) Exporters shall have the option to apply for benefit either under the Target Plus Scheme or under the Vishesh Krishi Upaj Yojana, but not both in respect of the same exported product/s. Provided that in calculating the entitlement under Para 3.7.3 the total eligible exports shall be taken into account for computing the percentage incremental growth but the duty credit entitlement shall be arrived at on the eligible exports reduced by the amount on which the benefit is claimed under para 3.8.2.\\n(4) All exports including exports under free shipping bill verified and authenticated by Customs and Gems & Jewellery shipping bills but excluding exports specified under para 3.7.5, shall be eligible for benefits under the Target Plus Scheme.\\n(5) In respect of export of Cut & Polished diamonds only those shipments would be taken into account for computation of eligible exports under the scheme where a minimum of 10% value addition has been achieved.\\n3.7.4 Applicant Companies\\nCompanies which are Star Export Houses as well as part of a Group company shall have an option to either apply as an individual company or as a Group based on the growth in the Group\\'s turnover as a whole. (For the purpose of this scheme the definition of Group Company as given in Chapter 9 will be applicable. Furthermore, only such companies of the Group as are Star Export Houses will be considered).\\nIf a Group company chooses to apply based on the export of one or more of its individual Star Export House companies, the entitlement would be calculated considering the export performance of the applicant company during the previous licencing year and current licencing year. It shall be necessary that the adjusted export performance of all the Star Export House companies of the Group during the current licencing year does not fall below the combined performance of all Star Export House companies of the Group in the previous licencing year.\\nIn case the Group chooses to apply based on the overall growth in Group\\'s turnover (i.e. the turnover of all the Star Export House companies), any one of the Star Export House companies of the Group may file an application on behalf of all the Star Export House companies of the Group.\\n3.7.5 The following exports shall not be taken into account for calculation of export performance or for computation of entitlement under the scheme:\\n(a) Export of imported goods covered under Para 2.35 of the Foreign Trade Policy or exports made through transshipment.\\n(b) Export turnover of units operating under SEZ/EOU/EHTP/STPI/BTP Schemes or products manufactured by them and exported through DTA units.\\n(c) Deemed exports (even when payments are received in Free Foreign Exchange and payment is made from EEFC account).\\n(d) Service exports.\\n(e) Rough, uncut and semi polished diamonds and other precious stones.\\n(f) Gold, silver, platinum and other precious metals in any form, including plain and studded Jewellery.\\n(g) Export performance made by one exporter on behalf of another exporter.\\n3.7.6 Imports allowed\\nThe Duty Credit may be used for import of any inputs, capital goods including spares, office equipment, professional equipment and office furniture provided the same is freely importable under ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items, for their own use or that of supporting manufacturers as declared in \\'Aayat Niryaat Form\\'.\\nImport of agricultural Products listed in Chapter 1 to 24 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items except the following shall be allowed:\\n(i) Garlic, Peas and all other Vegetables with a Duty of more than 30% under Chapter 7 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items.\\n(ii) Coconut, Areca Nut, Oranges, Lemon, Fresh Grapes, Apple and Pears and all other fruits with a Duty of more than 30% under Chapter 8 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items.\\n(iii) All spices with a Duty of more than 30# under Chapter 9 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items (except Cloves).\\n(iv) Tea, Coffee and Pepper as per Chapter 9 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import Items.\\n(v) All Oil Seeds under Chapter 12 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import Items.\\nFurther, Natural Rubber as per Chapter 40 of ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items shall also not be allowed for import under the Scheme.\\nImport of all edible oils classified under Chapter 15, shall be allowed under the scheme only through STC and MMTC.\\n3.7.7 CENVAT/Drawback\\nAdditional customs duty/excise duty paid in cash or through debit under Target Plus shall be adjusted as CENVAT Credit or Duty Drawback as per rules framed by the Department of Revenue.\\n3.7.8 Special Provision\\nGovernment reserves the right in public interest, to specify from time to time the category of exports and export products, which shall not be eligible for calculation of incremental growth/entitlement.\\nFurther the Government shall have the right to change the eligibility criteria and rate of entitlement under the scheme effective from the date of notification of this policy.\\nSimilarly, Government may from time to time also notify the list of goods, which shall not be allowed for import under the duty credit entitlement certificate issued under the scheme.\\n120. Provisions relating to star export houses were contained in para 3.5 of Chapter 1A of the said Policy, which enumerated the Status Category as well as the privileges which were to be enjoyed by these star export houses. Said para 3.5 is as under:\\n3.5 STAR EXPORT HOUSES\\n3.5.1 Star Export House\\nMerchant as well as Manufacturer Exporters, Service Providers, Export Oriented Units (EOUs) and Units located in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), Agri Export Zone (AEZ\\'s), Electronic Hardware Technology Parks (EHTPs), Software Technology Parks (STPs) and Bio Technology Parks (BTPs) shall be eligible for applying for status as Star Export Houses.\\n3.5.2 Status Category\\nThe applicant shall be categorized depending on his total FOB/FOR export performance during the current plus the previous three years:\\nNote: 1. Manufacturer exporters in Small Scale Industry/Tiny Sector/Cottage Sector, Units registered with KVICs/KVIBs, Units located in North Eastern States, Sikkim and J & K, Units exporting handloom/handicrafts/hand knotted or silk carpets, exporters exporting to countries in Latin America/CIS/sub-Saharan Africa as listed in Appendix-9, units having ISO 9000 (series)/ISO 14000(series)/WHOGMP/HACCP/SEI CMM level-II and above status granted by agencies listed in Appendix-6, exports of services and exports of agro products shall be entitled for double weightage of exports made for grant of Start Export House status.\\n2. Exports made on re-export basis shall not be counted for the purpose of recognition.\\n3. Exports made by a subsidiary of a limited company shall be counted towards export performance of the limited company for the purpose of recognition only if the limited company has a majority share holding in the subsidiary company.\\n4. In case the recognition is claimed based upon the current year\\'s export performance, same shall be considered only in case the exporter has export performance during any one of the preceding three years as well.\\n3.5.2.1 Privileges\\nA Star Export House shall be eligible for the following facilities:\\n(i) Licence/certificate/permissions and Customs clearances for both imports and exports on self-declaration basis;\\n(ii) Fixation of Input-Output norms on priority within 60 days;\\n(iii) Exemption from compulsory negotiation of documents through banks. The remittance, however, would continue to be received through banking channels;\\n(iv) 100% retention of foreign exchange in EEFC account;\\n(v) Enhancement in normal repatriation period from 180 days to 360 days;\\n(vi) Entitlement for consideration under the Target Plus Scheme; and\\n(vii) Exemption from furnishing of Bank Guarantee in Schemes under this Policy.\\n121. Chapter 3 of the EXIM Policy mentions various \\'promotional measures\\' and in para 3.2.5 thereof, it contained, inter alia, procedure for availing the benefit under TPS. Among other things, it was stipulated that the last date for filing of such applications shall be 31st of December and that the duty credit certificate shall be valid for a period of twenty four months from the date of issue, with a clear stipulation that revalidation of duty credit entitlement certificate shall not be allowed.\\n122. As is clear from the aforesaid provisions of TPS, the Central Government had announced an export incentive scheme under which star export houses were entitled to a duty free entitlement certificate at varying rates, depending on the quantum of incremental growth in exports achieved by them over their exports in the previous year. In terms of para 3.7.6, the Central Government issued Notification No. 32/2005 dated April 08, 2005 whereby it notified the duty credit of TPS which could be availed of in the course of import of any inputs, capital goods, including spares, office equipment, professional equipment and office furniture, provided the same is freely importable under the ITC (HS) classification of export and import items for their own use and that of supporting manufacturers, as declared in the application 17D. The exporters in these cases claim that relying on the aforesaid Scheme, they ensured that they achieved incremental exports.\\n123. Thereafter, however, the Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred by Section 5 of the Act issued Notification bearing No. 48 (RE 2005)/2004-2009 dated February 20, 2006. Vide this Notification, the Government amended the list of exports enumerated in para 3.7.5 of the FTP thereby excluding the exports of all types of forms of petroleum products covered under ITC (HS) codes 2706-2715 for the purpose of calculation of TPS and computation of its entitlement. This amendment was made effective from April 01, 2005 in respect of exports effected during April 01, 2005 to March 31, 2006. The relevant portion of the said Notification, with which we are concerned, reads as under:\\n6. In para 3.7.5, the following shall be inserted after sub para 3.7.5(f)\\n(g) Ores and Concentrates, of all types and in all forms.\\n(h) Cereals, of all types.\\n(i) Sugar, of all types and in all forms.\\n(j) Crude/Petroleum Oil & Crude/Petroleum based Products covered under ITC HS codes 2709 to 2715, of all types and in all forms.\\n124. It may be recollected that in para 3.7.5, certain items are specified which are not to be taken into account for calculation of exports performance or for computation of entitlement under the TPS. The effect of the aforesaid amendment was to exclude the aforementioned four items as well insofar as calculation of export performance or computation of entitlement under the TPS is concerned.\\n125. Another amendment to the TPS was made vide Notification No. 8(RE 2006)/2004-2009 dated June 12, 2006. It also pertained to the exports effected during April 01, 2005 to March 31, 2006. By this Notification, para 3.7.3 was substituted by the following para:\\nThe entitlement under this scheme would be contingent on the minimum percentage incremental growth of 20% in FOB value of exports in the current licensing year over the previous licensing year, and the rate of entitlement shall be 5% of the incremental growth.\\n126. Original para 3.7.3, which is in respect of \\'entitlement\\' under the TPS mentioned that the said entitlement would be contingent on the minimum percentage incremental growth in FOB value of exports in the current licensing year over the previous licensing year. The percentage incremental growth was subsequently stipulated in the table provided under the said para. As per that, if the incremental growth was 20% and above to below 25%, duty credit entitlement provided was 5%. In case of incremental growth of 25% or above, but below 100%, the duty credit growth entitlement was to the tune of 10%. On incremental growth of 100% and above, duty credit entitlement stipulated was 15% (of 100%). However, by way of amendment, the minimum percentage incremental growth was specified as 20% in the FOB value of exports in the current year over the previous year and entitlement was made uniform @ 5% of the incremental growth.\\n127. These Notifications are challenged on the ground that these export houses had achieved the desired target by making necessary exports within the stipulated period, i.e. April 01, 2005 to March 31, 2006 and thus got vested right to avail the entitlement as contained in para 3.7.6, which could not be reduced to 5%. It was also submitted that the various items exported included all types of forms of petroleum products covered under ITC (HS) codes 2706-2715 and these items could not be excluded by the aforesaid amendment. In nutshell, submission was that by giving retrospective effect to the amendment, which was in any case impermissible, even the vested right of these exporters was taken away. It can, thus, be seen that the arguments on vested right and retrospectivity are the same and the counsel who appeared in these matters advanced identical legal submissions.\\n128. We have already discussed these aspects in detail. To recapitulate, it is held by us that Section 5 of the Act does not empower the Government to make amendments with retrospective effect, thereby taking away the rights which have already accrued in favour of the exporters under the Scheme. No doubt, the Government has, otherwise, power to amend, modify or withdraw a particular Scheme which gives benefits to a particular category of persons under the said Scheme. At the same time, if some vested right has accrued in favour of the beneficiaries who achieved the target stipulated in the Scheme and thereby became eligible for grant of duty credit entitlement, that cannot be snatched from such persons/exporters by making the amendment retrospectively. In the present case, we find that Section 5 of the Act does not give any specific power to the Central Government to make the Rules with retrospective effect. The Central Government is authorised to make Rules/Schemes under the said provision as a delegatee, which means that the EXIM Policy/Scheme framed under the said provision is by way of delegated legislation. There has to be specific power to make the amendments with retrospective effect, which are lacking in the instant case. Moreover, even if there is such a power, it cannot take away vested rights which have accrued in favour of particular persons/exporters. We have already enlisted number of judgments of this Court taking such a view. A few such cases laying down the aforesaid principle are:\\n(i) \\nRegional Transport Officer, Chittoor and Others Vs. Associated Transport Madras (P) Ltd. and Others, \\n.\\n(ii) \\nAccountant General and Another Vs. S. Doraiswamy and Others, \\n.\\n(iii) \\nA.A. Calton Vs. Director of Education and Another, \\n\\n(iv) Chairman, Railway Board and Ors. v. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and Ors. (1997) 6 SCC 626\\n129. Keeping in view the aforesaid legal position, we embark on the discussion relevant for the purposes of these cases, namely, pertaining to TPS.\\n130. TPS, which was introduced in EXIM Policy 2004-2009 on August 31, 2004, adopted some of the features of the earlier Schemes in the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 and introduced the concept of Multi-Entitlement Rates, thus, allowing higher entitlement rates for higher growth. The Multi-Entitlement Rates depended upon the quantum of incremental growth achieved by particular exporters. As taken note of above, the TPS prescribed three rates of entitlement based on growth. It shows that TPS was in the nature of a reward Scheme and was somewhat different from the earlier Schemes which seek to neutralize the duty paid by the exporter. It intended to accelerate growth in export by rewarding star export houses who have achieved a quantum growth in exports.\\n131. Vide Notification No. 32/2005 dated April 08, 2005, the Central Government amended para 3.7.8 and instead of three rates of entitlement based on growth, it prescribed one single rate, i.e. 5% of the incremental growth. In replies given by the Government, no cogent or valid reason is given for this move. Interestingly, comments are made about the misuse of earlier Scheme in the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 and the evidence that surfaced during the said investigation, particularly with respect to the alleged dubious practices adopted by some exporters who had inflated their turnover in respect of gold and diamond exports and it is mentioned that under these circumstances, for \\'anticipating misuse\\', the Government came out with the aforesaid Notification. The amendment Notification is justified on the ground that in the Scheme itself it had preserved the right to change the eligibility criteria and rate of entitlement effective from the beginning of the year, in public interest. Thus, the action is justified on the ground that such a power was reserved in the TPS itself and that measure was taken to avoid misuse by unscrupulous exporters. Nowhere it is stated that there was misuse by any of these parties.\\n132. Pertinently, it is also not denied that these Petitioners/exporters had achieved the quantum/incremental growth, as stipulated in the TPS, which made them eligible to get the rewards under the said Scheme. These exporters, therefore, had fulfilled the conditions contained in the TPS. The Scheme was floated to accelerate quantum growth in exports and when those star export houses achieved the quantum growth in exports, as stated in para 3.7.3, they would naturally become entitled to a particular percentage of duty credit entitlement depending upon the quantum of growth achieved. These exporters, thus, got vested right to avail the duty credit entitlement and achieve higher rate, i.e. 10% or 15%, as the case may be. Reducing the same to 5% would clearly amount to taking away their vested right with the issuing of the Notification and making them effective retrospectively.\\n133. Likewise, no cogent explanation is coming forward for adding four items by amending para 3.7.5 vide Notification No. 48 (RE 2005)/2004-2009 dated February 20, 2006. The only argument advanced at the time of hearing was that the Government felt that benefit of TPS should not be extended to the exporters of these items. That may be a policy decision and the Government is empowered to take such a decision. It may be noted that in para 3.7.5 of TPS, as was originally provided, certain items of exports were specifically mentioned, which were not to be taken into account for calculation of export performance or for computation of entitlement under the Scheme and the items now added vide Notification No. 48 (RE 2005)/2004-2009 dated February 20, 2006 were not mentioned therein. If the Government realised afterwards that export of these items should not have been given the benefit of TPS and extending the benefit to now excluded items was an ill-considered move, though the Central Government was free to withdraw it in respect of such items but it could do so only prospectively, but was not entitled to do so with effect from the back date, i.e. April 01, 2005, by taking away the vested right that had already accrued in favour of exporters of these items.\\n134. As a result, we hold that Notification No. 48/2005 dated February 20, 2006 and Notification No. 8/2006 dated June 12, 2006 cannot be applied retrospectively and they would be effective only from the dates they were issued.\\n135. Writ Petition (Civil) No. 27 of 2008, Transfer Case (Civil) Nos. 32 and 33 of 2007 (which were the writ petitions filed by exporters before the High Court) are, thus, allowed in the aforesaid terms. The Transfer Case arising out of Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 568 of 2014, which was the writ appeal filed by DGFT before the High Court is dismissed thereby confirming the order of the Gujarat High Court allowing the writ petition filed by the exporter, namely, M/s. Welspun India Limited.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997343.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content='@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nMadan B. Lokur, J@mdashThese appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 11th November, 2008 passed by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur. Criminal Appeal No. 126 of 2010 has been filed by the State of Rajasthan challenging the refusal of the High Court to uphold the conviction of Daud Khan for an offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (for short the Indian Penal Code). Criminal Appeal No. 351 of 2010 is filed by Daud Khan challenging his conviction for an offence punishable under the first part of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code.\\n2. The broad facts leading to the decision of the High Court are that on 19th June, 2004 at about 9.30 p.m. Nand Singh had gone to Bathra Telecom & Restaurant at Nimbahera, District Pratapgarh in Rajasthan. He was accompanied by his friends Nitin Sindhi (accused No. 3) and Narendra Kumawat. While they were seated in the restaurant, Javed Beg (accused No. 2) and Daud Khan (accused No. 1) came there on a motor cycle. It appears that Javed Beg and Daud Khan had some grudge against Nand Singh concerning the result of a cricket match between India and Pakistan.\\n3. According to the prosecution, Javed Beg brandished a knife and told Nand Singh that today his end had come. Thereupon Daud Khan fired upon Nand Singh with a loaded pistol on the right side of his chest and then both of them escaped on their motor cycle. They were chased by Narendra Kumawat and Nitin Sindhi but they were not successful in apprehending the assailants.\\n4. Thereafter, Narendra Kumawat and Nitin Sindhi took Nand Singh to a nearby hospital on their motorcycle but Nand Singh was declared brought dead. Thereupon, Narendra Kumawat went to Nand Singh\\'s residence and informed his brother PW-1 Gajendra Singh about the incident. Gajendra Singh also visited the hospital and then lodged FIR No. 374/04 on 19th June, 2004 with the Nimbahera Police Station at about 10.30 p.m. Daud Khan and Javed Beg were named as the two accused persons.\\n5. On 21st June, 2004 Daud Khan was arrested. Thereafter, Javed Beg was arrested on 15th July, 2004. The gun used by Daud Khan to shoot Nand Singh was recovered at his instance from Javed Khan\\'s possession. Nitin Sindhi was arrested on 28th July, 2007.\\n6. A charge-sheet was filed against all three persons and it was alleged that Daud Khan was guilty of offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act while the others were guilty of an offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 thereof and Section 109 read with Section 302 thereof.\\n7. The case was tried by the Additional District & Sessions (Fast Track) Camp Nimbahera, District Pratapgarh as Sessions Case No. 103 of 2005. In his judgment and order, the Trial Judge convicted Daud Khan of an offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act. Javed Beg was convicted of an offence punishable Under Section 3 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act but was found not guilty of an offence Under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Nitin Sindhi was found not guilty of any offence. The accused persons were appropriately sentenced.\\n8. Feeling aggrieved by the decision of the Trial Court, appeals were filed in the High Court by Daud Khan and Javed Beg challenging their conviction and by the State challenging the partial acquittal of Javed Beg and complete acquittal of Nitin Sindhi. By its judgment and order dated 11th November, 2008 the High Court came to the conclusion that Daud Khan was not guilty of an offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code but was guilty of an offence punishable under the first part of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. His conviction Under Section 3 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act was maintained. As far as the conviction of Javed Beg under the Arms Act is concerned, it was upheld by the High Court, but the sentence was reduced. The High Court also dismissed the appeal filed by the State against the acquittal of Javed Beg of the offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and the complete acquittal of Nitin Sindhi.\\n9. Feeling aggrieved, the present appeals have been filed, as mentioned above, by Daud Khan and the State.\\nDecision of the Trial Court\\n10. Before the Trial Court, quite a few contentions were urged. It was contended that the First Information Report (FIR) is suspicious inasmuch as in the newspapers the next day, it was reported that unknown persons (strangers) had committed the murder of Nand Singh in an STD booth. The police had arrived at the spot and taken the injured (Nand Singh) to the hospital. It was argued that a report in this regard was lodged, but thereafter removed from the record and suppressed. That apart, it was argued that the FIR was lodged after a delay of one and half hours and reliance was placed on \\nThulia Kali Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, \\nIn addition to this, it was argued that there was considerable unexplained delay in informing the Magistrate of the lodging of the FIR. The delay was to the extent of one day and 13 (thirteen) hours (a total of about 36/37 hours). There was enough time, therefore, to manipulate the facts so as to involve the accused.\\n11. It was also contended that the mere recovery of a pistol (from Javed) was not enough to hold Daud Khan guilty. In any event, the opinion of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) was not definite that the bullet taken out from the body of Nand Singh was fired from the recovered pistol. Additionally, it was argued that according to the witnesses, the shot had been fired from a close distance but the post mortem report did not indicate any blackening of the skin which would have happened had the shot been fired from a close range. It was sought to be suggested that the eye witnesses were perhaps not present when the incident occurred and a story was made up to involve Daud Khan.\\n12. The defence contended that the incident did not occur at the place where it is said to have occurred. In support of this contention, it was argued that the body of Nand Singh was found 70 (seventy) feet away, across the road and near the tyre repair shop, a long distance from where he was allegedly sitting in Bathra Telecom. No blood was found where the shooting took place, but blood was found only near the tyre repair shop. This was most unlikely particularly when Nand Singh had been shot near a vital part of his body on the chest. Therefore, not only was the presence of witnesses suspicious but the place of occurrence was also doubtful.\\n13. The Trial Court did not place any reliance on the newspaper reports since there was nothing to show that a report had been filed with the concerned police station that unknown persons had committed the crime. The Trial Court also found that the time taken for lodging the FIR (about one and a half hours) was explained under the circumstances, since Nand Singh had been taken to the hospital and his brother Gajendra Singh (PW-1) had to be informed of the incident. The delay was found to be not unreasonable. However, the Trial Court did not deal with the delay in informing the Magistrate of the lodging of the FIR.\\n14. The Trial Court accepted the recovery of the pistol, as well as unused cartridges, from Javed at the instance of Daud Khan. The Trial Court also took the view that the FSL report clearly stated that a bullet had been fired from the pistol and it was not stated that the bullet taken out from the body of Nand Singh could not have been fired from the recovered pistol. The Trial Court also held that Nand Singh\\'s skin was not blackened since he was wearing a vest and a shirt. Therefore, fully believing the version of the eye witnesses, it was held that Daud Khan shot Nand Singh at the place of occurrence and there were several witnesses present at that time. On this basis, the Trial Court convicted Daud Khan of an offence punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.\\nDecision of the High Court\\n15. Before the High Court, somewhat more elaborate contentions were urged on behalf of Daud Khan. The primary contentions urged (and they were repeated before us) were that the FSL report falsifies the version of the eye witnesses. It was urged that according to the witnesses, the gun shot was fired from a distance of about 4 (four) feet. Despite this, there was no blackening of Nand Singh\\'s skin. The High Court rejected this contention on the ground that the witnesses had stated that \\'the shot was fired from nearby\\' and that \\'None of the eye witnesses has stated that it was fired from a distance of less than 4 ft.\\' There might be some variation in the distance but that could not be fatal to the case of the prosecution. That apart, merely because there was no blackening of the skin does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that the shot was fired from a distance.\\n16. It was submitted that the gun was recovered from Javed and not from Daud Khan. The High Court was of the view that while this may be so, it did not rule out the possibility of Daud Khan handing over the weapon to Javed. This submission was not pressed before us and we need not spend any further time on this except to note that the Trial Court found that the recovery was at the instance of Daud Khan.\\n17. It was argued that the news report that appeared the next day was obtained from the Superintendent of Police and that was to the effect that some unknown persons were involved in the shooting. The High Court rejected this submission and held that news reports could not be treated as evidence. This submission was faintly adverted to before us as well, but is hardly decisive one way or the other.\\n18. It was urged that earth stained with the blood of Nand Singh was recovered about 70 (seventy) feet away from the place of incident. This was an indication that the shooting did not take place at Bathra Telecom but elsewhere. It was urged that the High Court was in error in disbelieving DW-1 Chhotu Khan who stated that someone from a truck near his tyre shop had shot Nand Singh. The High Court was of the opinion that the reason why the blood stains were found elsewhere was because Nand Singh had run away after being shot and had fallen down about 70 (seventy) feet away. It is for this reason also that the High Court disbelieved DW-1 Chhotu Khan whose version of the events was held to be an afterthought.\\n19. Finally, it was urged that there was an unexplained delay in the Magistrate receiving the FIR (after about 37 hours). The High Court noted this submission but unfortunately (like the Trial Court) did not deal with it.\\n20. On an overall conspectus of the facts of the case, the view canvassed on behalf of Daud Khan was that the witnesses to the shooting could not be believed. The High Court rejected this view.\\n21. The High Court, however, felt that a case of murder punishable Under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was not made out since Daud Khan had fired only one bullet and did not take undue advantage of the situation and therefore only a case of intention to cause bodily harm that was likely to cause death was made out, punishable under the first part of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. Accordingly, Daud Khan was convicted of that offence and sentenced to 7 (seven) years rigorous imprisonment with fine.\\n22. Feeling aggrieved, Daud Khan is before us in appeal.\\nDelay in lodging the FIR: submissions and discussion\\n23. It was submitted that the FIR lodged by PW-1 Gajendra Singh was ante-dated. Actually the FIR was lodged on 20th June 2004 but was ante-dated to 19th June 2004. It was submitted that this is apparent from the overwriting on the FIR. The insinuation was that it was first decided to \"fix\" the accused and thereafter the FIR was lodged to that effect. We see no substance in this contention. We have seen the FIR in original and find nothing to suggest any semblance of any overwriting. We may also note that no such submission was made before the Trial Court or the High Court.\\n24. It was also argued that there was a delay in lodging the FIR. Reference was made to \\nLalita Kumari Vs. Govt. of U.P. and Others, \\n(Constitution Bench). We find no substance in this contention as well. The incident is stated to have occurred at about 9.30 pm. The FIR was lodged at about 10.30 pm. There is hardly any \\'delay\\' in lodging of the FIR. It must be added, however, that this argument was premised on the assumption that the FIR was lodged on 20th June 2004 and not on 19th June 2004, a contention we have already rejected.\\nSection 157 of the Code of Criminal Procedure: submissions and discussion\\n25. It was then submitted that there was an unexplained delay in receipt of the FIR by the Magistrate-a delay of about 36/37 hours since the copy of the FIR was received by him on 21st June 2004 at about 11.00 am. According to learned Counsel for Daud Khan this was in violation of Section 157 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short \\'the Code of Criminal Procedure) which requires a copy of the FIR (called a special report or an express report) to be sent forthwith to the concerned Magistrate.1\\n26. The interpretation of Section 157 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is no longer res integra. A detailed discussion on the subject is to be found in \\nBrahm Swaroop and Another Vs. State of U.P., \\nwhich considered a large number of cases on the subject. The purpose of the \"forthwith\" communication of a copy of the FIR to the Magistrate is to check the possibility of its manipulation. Therefore, a delay in transmitting the special report to the Magistrate is linked to the lodging of the FIR. If there is no delay in lodging an FIR, then any delay in communicating the special report to the Magistrate would really be of little consequence, since manipulation of the FIR would then get ruled out. Nevertheless, the prosecution should explain the delay in transmitting the special report to the Magistrate. However, if no question is put to the investigating officer concerning the delay, the prosecution is under no obligation to give an explanation. There is no universal rule that whenever there is some delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, the prosecution version becomes unreliable. In other words, the facts and circumstances of a case are important for a decision in this regard.\\n27. The delay in sending the special report was also the subject of discussion in a recent decision being \\nSheo Shankar Singh Vs. State of U.P., \\nwherein it was held that before such a contention is countenanced, the accused must show prejudice having been caused by the delayed dispatch of the FIR to the Magistrate. It was held, relying upon several earlier decisions as follows:\\n30. One other submission made on behalf of the Appellants was that in the absence of any proof of forwarding the FIR copy to the jurisdiction Magistrate, violation of Section 157 Code of Criminal Procedure has crept in and thereby, the very registration of the FIR becomes doubtful. The said submission will have to be rejected, inasmuch as the FIR placed before the Court discloses that the same was reported at 4.00 p.m. on 13-6-1979 and was forwarded on the very next day viz. 14-6-1979. Further, a perusal of the impugned judgments of the High Court as well as of the trial court discloses that no case of any prejudice was shown nor even raised on behalf of the Appellants based on alleged violation of Section 157 Code of Criminal Procedure. Time and again, this Court has held that unless serious prejudice was demonstrated to have been suffered as against the accused, mere delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate by itself will not have any deteriorating (sic) effect on the case of the prosecution. Therefore, the said submission made on behalf of the Appellants cannot be sustained.\\n31. In this context, we would like to refer to a recent decision of this Court in \\nSandeep Vs. State of U.P., \\nwherein the said position has been explained as under in paras 62-63: (SCC p. 132)\\n62. It was also feebly contended on behalf of the Appellants that the express report was not forwarded to the Magistrate as stipulated Under Section 157 Code of Criminal Procedure instantaneously. According to the learned Counsel FIR which was initially registered on 17-11-2004 was given a number on 19-11-2004 as FIR No. 116 of 2004 and it was altered on 20-11-2004 and was forwarded only on 25-11-2004 to the Magistrate. As far as the said contention is concerned, we only wish to refer to the reported decision of this Court in \\nPala Singh and Another Vs. State of Punjab, \\nwherein this Court has clearly held that (SCC p. 645, para 8) where the FIR was actually recorded without delay and the investigation started on the basis of that FIR and there is no other infirmity brought to the notice of the court then, however improper or objectionable the delay in receipt of the report by the Magistrate concerned be, in the absence of any prejudice to the accused it cannot by itself justify the conclusion that the investigation was tainted and the prosecution insupportable.\\n63. Applying the above ratio in Pala Singh to the case on hand, while pointing out the delay in the forwarding of the FIR to the Magistrate, no prejudice was said to have been caused to the Appellants by virtue of the said delay. As far as the commencement of the investigation is concerned, our earlier detailed discussion discloses that there was no dearth in that aspect. In such circumstances we do not find any infirmity in the case of the prosecution on that score. In fact the above decision was subsequently followed in \\nSarwan Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab, \\nAnil Rai Vs. State of Bihar, \\nand \\nAqeel Ahmad Vs. State of U.P., \\n.\\n28. It is no doubt true that one of the external checks against ante-dating or ante-timing an FIR is the time of its dispatch to the Magistrate or its receipt by the Magistrate. The dispatch of a copy of the FIR \"forthwith\" ensures that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR.2 If the prosecution is asked to give an explanation for the delay in the dispatch of a copy of the FIR, it ought to do so.3 However, if the court is convinced of the prosecution version\\'s truthfulness and trustworthiness of the witnesses, the absence of an explanation may not be regarded as detrimental to the prosecution case. It would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.4\\n29. In so far as the present case is concerned, there was no delay in lodging the FIR. Hence the question of its manipulation does not arise. Additionally, the officer in charge of the police station, PW-21 Surender Singh was not asked any question about the delay in sending the special report to the Magistrate. An explanation was, however, sought from the investigating officer PW-25 Rajinder Parik who tersely responded by saying that it was not his duty to send the special report to the court (or the Magistrate). In the absence of any question having been asked of the officer who could have given an answer, namely, the officer in charge of the police station, no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution in this regard, nor can it be held that the delay in receipt of the special report by the Magistrate is fatal to the case of the prosecution. This is apart from the consistent evidence of the eye witnesses, which we shall advert to a little later.\\nBallistics report: submissions and discussion\\n30. It was vehemently contended that the report of the FSL (Exhibit P-37) did not conclusively say that the bullet recovered from the body of Nand Singh was fired from the pistol recovered from Javed at the instance of Daud Khan. The FSL report reads as follows:\\n1. One.32 country made revolver (W/1) from packet \\'E\\' in (is) a serviceable firearm. However, it has the tendency to misfire the ammunition.\\n2. The examination of the barrel residue indicates that submitted one.32 country made revolver (W/1) had been fired. However, the definite time of its last fire could not be ascertained.\\n3. Based on the stereo and microscopic examination, it is the opinion that it has not been possible to link definitely one 7.65 mm cartridge case (C/1) from packet \\'E\\' and one.32 copper jacket bullet (B/1) from packet \\'D\\' with submitted one.32 revolver (W/1) from packet \\'E\\' due to lack of sufficient evidence.\\n31. A perusal of the FSL report suggests that it is not conclusive one way or the other whether the bullet extracted from the body of Nand Singh had or had not been fired from the pistol recovered from Javed at the instance of Daud Khan. In view of this, learned Counsel placed reliance on \\nMohinder Singh Vs. The State, \\n. The facts of that case were quite unique. The deceased-Dalip Singh was said to have suffered two injuries, one inflicted on his chest with a gun used by Appellant-Mohinder Singh and the other near his ear while he was lying sideways, inflicted by Gurnam Singh with a rifle from a distance of about 4-5 feet. According to the definite case of the prosecution, Appellant-Mohinder Singh had fired from a gun, but this was not accepted by this Court which felt that the injury attributed to Appellant-Mohinder Singh was caused by a rifle. In other words, there was a mismatch between the weapon and the bullet. In this context, this Court observed as follows:\\nIn a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are alleged to have been caused. It is elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove the whole of that case. In the present case, it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the Appellant [Mohinder Singh] were caused by a gun or by a rifle. Indeed, it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun, and yet the case for the prosecution is that the Appellant was armed with a gun, and, in his examination, it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P-16. It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the Appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire-arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence.\\n32. And, what was the opinion of the expert in that case? This Court noted that the opinion of the Director, C.I.D. Laboratory, Philaur could be summed up in the following words:\\nThe gun had signs of having been fired but he [the expert] could not say when it was fired last. The cartridge cases P-10 and P-15 could have been fired through the gun P-16, but he could not say whether they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns. He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P-16, nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P-10 and P-15.\\n33. On this basis, it was observed that according to the prosecution, two shots were fired at the deceased-Dalip Singh and \"one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man, and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses. There is, in our opinion, a gap in the prosecution evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap......\" In view of this gap in the prosecution evidence, this Court gave the benefit of doubt to the Appellant-Mohinder Singh. Additionally, this Court did not believe the three eye witnesses since two of them were chance witnesses and \"not altogether independent persons\" while the third was a partisan witness and his testimony was otherwise improbable since he claimed to have witnessed the shooting after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck.\\n34. In so far as the present appeal is concerned, the facts of the case are quite different. Although the FSL report was inconclusive in the sense that it could not be stated whether the extracted bullet could be \\'definitely\\' linked to the recovered weapon, but there was no doubt that the extracted bullet was capable of being fired from the recovered gun. In other words (and this is important) there was no mismatch between the bullet and the gun. Mohinder Singh, therefore, does not come to the aid of Daud Khan. However, learned Counsel sought to cash in on the absence of definitiveness by relying on \\nAbdul Sayeed Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, \\nbut that decision is also of no relevance. In that case, there was a conflict between the medical evidence and the ocular evidence, while in this case there is no such conflict. There is no doubt both from the medical and the ocular evidence that Daud Khan had shot with a gun. The forensic evidence shows that the bullet extracted from the body of Nand Singh was capable of being fired from the recovered gun. Whether Nand Singh was shot by use of the recovered gun or some other gun was not questioned and none of the witnesses was asked any substantive question about the gun recovered from Javed at the instance of Daud Khan or whether it was the same gun (or a different one) used by Daud Khan.\\nBlackening of the skin: submissions and discussion\\n35. It was contended that since Nand Singh was shot from a close distance, there would have some blackening of his skin, but the post mortem report did not show any such blackening. It was contended, on this basis, that Nand Singh was actually shot elsewhere (where he collapsed) and not at the place suggested by the prosecution.\\n36. PW-11 Narendra Kumawat who had accompanied Nand Singh and was with him when the incident occurred stated that Daud Khan had fired from a distance of about two feet. Similarly, PW-19 Suraj Mal stated that the bullet was fired from a distance of two feet, while PW-7 Mahabir Singh stated that the bullet was fired from a distance of one foot. PW-23 Narender Singh stated that the bullet was fired from a distance of \\'four fingers and the bullet was not fired touching the pistol to the chest.\\' Finally, PW-24 Rishi Raj Shekhawat stated that \"Fire was not made after touching the chest of Nand Singh, rather it was fired from the distance of one or two feet.\" Therefore, each of the eye witnesses stated that the shot was fired by Daud Khan at Nand Singh from very close quarters and in any event from a distance of two feet or less. The High Court found, incorrectly, that the witnesses had testified that the shooting had occurred from nearby but no distance was mentioned by any witness.\\n37. Be that as it may, at this stage, reference may be made to Modi\\'s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology5 wherein it is noted, with reference to blackening of the skin in a gunshot wound, as follows:\\nIf a firearm is discharged very close to the body or in actual contact, subcutaneous tissues over an area of two or three inches round the wound of entrance are lacerated and the surrounding skin is usually scorched and blackened by smoke and tattoed with unburnt grains of gunpowder or smokeless propellant powder. The adjacent hairs are singed, and the clothes covering the part are burnt by the flame. If the powder is smokeless, there may be a grayish or white deposit on the skin around the wound. If the area is photographed by infrared light, a smoke halo round the wound may be clearly noticed. Blackening is found, if a firearm like a shotgun is discharged from a distance of not more than three feet and a revolver or a pistol discharged within about two feet....\\n38. Under the circumstances, in all likelihood if Nand Singh was in fact shot at from a close range of about two feet or less, there would have been some blackening of his skin. The Trial Court acknowledged this but was of the opinion that since Nand Singh was wearing a vest and a shirt (Exhibit P-6) his skin was perhaps prevented from being blackened by the gunshot wound. That may be so, but there is no evidence, one way or the other, that the vest and shirt of Nand Singh were blackened or not, nor was any question asked of any witness in this regard. Therefore, we have no reason to dispute the conclusion of the Trial Court.\\nBlood trail: submissions and discussion\\n39. Learned Counsel for Daud Khan referred to an odd circumstance, which is that Nand Singh managed to cover on foot a distance of about 70 (seventy) feet after being shot in the chest. Throughout this distance, there was no blood trail, nor was any blood spilt at the place of occurrence. In \\nMeharaj Singh (L/Nk.) Vs. State of U.P., \\nthe absence of blood at the place of occurrence or any blood trail from the place of occurrence to the place where the corpse was found led this Court (among other things) to doubt the prosecution story.\\n40. However, the evidence on record in this case does not leave any doubt in this regard. PW-14 Dr. Tej Singh Dangi (one of the members of the Board that conducted the post mortem) stated that he could not give any opinion about blood being spilt under such circumstances and that it is not necessary that blood would fall outside if any part of the body is injured. On the other hand, PW-15 Dr. K. Asif (another member of the Board that conducted the post mortem) was of the view that blood might have fallen at the place of occurrence, \"but the blood in small quantity comes out from [the] wound which is caused by the entry of the bullet and the blood in large quantity comes out from the exit injury of the bullet.\" It is, therefore, not surprising that there was no spillage of Nand Singh\\'s blood at the place of the incident.\\n41. It has come on record that Nand Singh was a young and healthy person. While it may seem odd that he could have run a distance of about 70 (seventy) feet with a bullet in his chest, it might not be improbable. The best persons to have been asked to explain this would have been the medical experts, but no question was put to them in this regard. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of Nand Singh having traversed the distance before collapsing across the road.\\nDock identification: submissions and discussion\\n42. It was contended by Daud Khan that the three chance witnesses, PW-7 Mahabir Singh, PW-23 Narender Singh and PW-24 Rishi Raj Shekhawat were all from out of town. As such, they could not have identified Daud Khan or Javed. It was further contended that no test identification parade (for short TIP) was conducted and reliance could not have been placed only on their dock identification.\\n43. No such argument was raised by Daud Khan either in the Trial Court or in the High Court and we see no reason to permit such an argument being raised at this stage.\\n44. That apart, it was recently held in \\nAshok Debbarma @ Achak Debbarma Vs. State of Tripura, \\nthat while the evidence of identification of an accused at a trial is admissible as a substantive piece of evidence, it would depend on the facts of a given case whether or not such a piece of evidence could be relied upon as the sole basis for conviction of an accused. It was held that if the witnesses are trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact that no TIP was conducted would not, by itself, be a reason for discarding the evidence of those witnesses. In arriving at this conclusion, this Court relied upon a series of decisions.6 Earlier, a similar view was expressed in \\nSidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma Vs. State (NCT of Delhi), \\n, paragraphs 255 to 258.\\n45. In any event, there were two other witnesses to the shooting, namely, PW-11 Narender Kumawat and PW-19 Suraj Mal who were local residents and knew Nand Singh and Daud Khan and could easily identify them.\\n46. Five witnesses have testified to the events that took place at Bathra Telecom on the night of 19th June 2004. We see no reason to disbelieve any of them, particularly since they have all given a consistent statement of the events. There are some minor discrepancies, which are bound to be there, such as the distance between the gun and Nand Singh but these do not take away from the substance of the case of the prosecution nor do they impinge on the credibility of the witnesses.\\nConclusion\\n47. If the facts of the case are looked at individually and randomly, they might create a doubt. However, if they are considered collectively, there is no room for doubt. The facts collectively are: (i) Nand Singh was shot with a gun. (ii) The bullet extracted from the body of Nand Singh could have been fired from that gun, or to put it negatively, it cannot be said that the extracted bullet could not have been fired from the recovered gun. Nobody questioned this. (iii) The gun-shot was fired from a close distance, but there was no blackening of Nand Singh\\'s skin possibly due to his apparel. Nobody questioned this. (iv) Nand Singh\\'s death was not immediate and he could have traversed a distance of about 70 (seventy) feet despite being shot. Nobody questioned this. (v) The medical experts testified that spillage of blood from the entry wound is not inevitable and so it is possible that Nand Singh\\'s blood was not found between the place of the incident and the place where he collapsed. The blood was, however, found where Nand Singh collapsed. (vi) There were five eye witnesses to the incident of shooting and they gave consistent statements and identified Daud Khan as the person who shot Nand Singh. None of these findings and conclusions are perverse. On the contrary, they have been accepted by the Trial Court and the High Court. We see no reason to take a different view.\\n48. On a consideration of the entire material before us, we have no hesitation in upholding the view taken by the High Court with regard to the offence committed by Daud Khan and his conviction for that offence. We see no substance in the appeal filed by the State and find no reason to reverse the conclusions arrived at by the High Court with regard to the offence committed by Daud Khan.\\n49. Both the appeals are dismissed.\\n\\n\\n1157. Procedure for investigation.--(1) If, from information received or otherwise, an officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered Under Section 156 to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence upon a police report and shall proceed in person, or shall depute one of his subordinate officers not being below such rank as the State Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this behalf, to proceed, to the spot, to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case, and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender:Provided that--(a) when information as to the commission of any such offence is given against any person by name and the case is not of a serious nature, the officer in charge of a police station need not proceed in person or depute a subordinate officer to make an investigation on the spot,(b) if it appears to the officer in charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he shall not investigate the case:Provided further that in relation to an offence of rape, the recording of statement of the victim shall be conducted at the residence of the victim or in the place of her choice and as far as practicable by a woman police officer in the presence of her parents or guardian or near relatives or social worker of the locality.(2) In each of the cases mentioned in Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to Sub-section (1), the officer in charge of the police station shall state in his report his reasons for not fully complying with the requirements of that Sub-section, and, in the case mentioned in Clause (b) of the said proviso, the officer shall also forthwith notify to the informant, if any, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the fact that he will not investigate the case or cause it to be investigated.2Sudershan v.

Dave, J@mdashThe Appellants have challenged the validity of the judgment dated 18th May, 2005, delivered by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam.\\n2. By virtue of the impugned judgment, the Appellants have been directed to consider the case of the Respondent for appointment to a suitable post on compassionate ground as the husband of the Respondent had died in harness.\\n3. After the death of her husband in the year 1999, the Respondent made a request to the Appellants/employers to consider her case for appointment on compassionate ground.\\n4. There is a policy for making an appointment on compassionate grounds and as per the said policy, according to the Appellants, the claimants, who are more deserving for appointment on compassionate grounds, are given appointment and therefore, though the case of the Respondent was considered, she could not be appointed as there were claimants who were more needy than the Respondent. In the circumstances, the Respondent had approached the Central Administrative Tribunal and the Tribunal directed the Appellants to again consider the case of the Respondent for appointment on compassionate ground. Being aggrieved by the order passed by the Tribunal, the Appellants had filed a writ petition before the High Court, which has been dismissed and therefore, this appeal.\\n5. Upon perusal of the record, we find that the Respondent was not given appointment on compassionate ground as per the policy of the Appellants because, as per the policy, more deserving candidates were available for giving appointment on the compassionate ground. In the circumstances, according to the Appellants, the direction was not justifiable as the case of the Respondent had already been considered thrice but every time the persons who were more deserving were appointed on compassionate ground.\\n6. In our opinion, the Respondent has no right to be appointed on compassionate ground on the death of her husband if there is somebody more needy than the Respondent. It is clear from the record that the policy of the Appellants has been strictly adhered to in the matter of giving appointment on compassionate ground.\\n7. In the circumstances, in our opinion, the Tribunal was not right in giving the direction to the Appellants to consider the case of the Respondent again and again, especially when the case of the Respondent had been duly considered and had been rejected, in view of the fact that more deserving claimants were available at the relevant time. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court committed an error by upholding the order of the Tribunal.\\n8. The impugned judgment passed by the High Court is set aside and the appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997341.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content=\"@JUDGMENTTAG-JUDGMENT\\nKurian Joseph, J@mdashThe Appellant-Ganga Bai was tried before the Additional Sessions Judge, Nimbahera, Rajasthan along with one Udai Lal and Daulat Ram Under Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) (hereinafter referred to as 'Indian Penal Code ') for the murder of her daughter-in-law and her two minor children. All the three were convicted Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code and were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. There was also a sentence of fine with default clause.\\n2. In appeal, the High Court acquitted Udai Lal and Daulat Ram holding that the offences against them were not proved beyond doubt. However, in the case of the Appellant, the conviction was confirmed with no modification in sentence.\\n3. The incident is of the year 1999. First Information Report was registered on the complaint given by PW-29. It was stated that while he was in the field gazing cattle, he heard PW-3 crying loudly of having seen a dead body of a lady lying in a trench. Along with PW-4, they also found the dead bodies of two children dumped in the trench. On 06.09.1999, the Appellant and Udai Lal were arrested, and Daulat Ram was arrested on 09.09.1999. All of them were charged Under Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 201 Indian Penal Code.\\n4. Though at the trial, many of the witnesses turned hostile, the Sessions Court convicted all the accused holding that the circumstantial evidence, the evidence of recovery and the presence of blood stains on the clothes of Appellant and Udai Lal, were sufficient to convict them for the offence Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code. The High Court acquitted Udai Lal and Daulat Ram, and hence, the appeal is only at the instance of Ganga Bai.\\n5. It is contented that the conviction cannot be sustained since the chain of evidence on circumstantial evidence is not complete. It is further contended that Udai Lal, at whose instance, one of the blood stained weapons, viz., dhariya was recovered, having been acquitted, the Appellant also is liable to be acquitted.\\n6. We have heard the Counsel appearing for the State also.\\n7. The prosecution has relied on the following evidence:\\n(1) The deceased was last seen in the company of Appellant Smt. Ganga Bai.\\n(2) The verification of place of incident at the instance of Appellant Smt. Ganga Bai.\\n(3) The recovery of weapon of offence namely Dharia, spade and kulhari.\\n(4) Recovery of blood-stained clothes of Appellant Smt. Ganga Bai.\\n(5) Recovery of anklet of the deceased in pursuance of the information given by Appellant Ganga Bai.\\n8. It has come out in the evidence of PW-5-Shanti Devi, who is the wife of PW-6-Naresh Kumar, the landlord of the deceased-Sunanda and her husband-Ratanlal (son of the Appellant), that accused-Ganga Bai used to visit the deceased-Sunanda in her room. The said witness stated that she had seen Sunanda with Appellant before her disappearance. It has also come out in her evidence that the Appellant, after the incident, came back to her, paid the rent and took away the belongings of the deceased. PW-6-Naresh Kumar has supported the version of PW-5. PW-7-is Sultana who has also stated that the deceased along with her children was seen with the Appellant in the market and the deceased had told her that the Appellant was taking them to Morvan. PW-8-husband of Sultana has supported her version. Thus, on the basis of the evidence of PWs-5 to 8, both the courts below have come to the conclusion that all the deceased were last seen with the Appellant.\\n9. It has also come out from the evidence of PW-S that the Appellant was not happy with the deceased for two reasons, viz., (i) she had already been married to another person and he had left her with her two children born to him and (ii) she belonged to a different caste. Therefore, if the Appellant had accepted them in their family, they would have been cast out from the village. It is because of that only the deceased along with her family had left the Appellant's house and stayed in the rented accommodation provided by PW-5. It has also come out from her evidence that the deceased had given the phone number of paternal house and family photo of the deceased along with her husband and children to her to be handed over to her father in case she did not return. Yet another incriminating circumstance is the conduct of the Appellant, after the incident, of settling the rent with PW-5 and removing belongings of the deceased.\\n10. On the second circumstance on verification of the place of incident by the Appellant, the High Court rightly discarded the same holding that the Police had already identified the place where the dead bodies were dumped. The other circumstantial evidence against the Appellant is on the recovery of weapon of offence. It has come in evidence that the recovery was effected only on the basis of the disclosure made by the Appellant as per Exhibit-P67. It has come in evidence that Exhibit-P53-dharia contained human blood. The third piece of circumstantial evidence found against the Appellant is the recovery of blood-stained clothes belonging to her as per Exhibit-P66-disclosure. The Appellant could not give any explanation of the presence of human blood on her clothes recovered as per Exhibit-P52. Though the anklet, said to be belonging to the deceased-Sunanda, was also recovered pursuant to her disclosure, the High Court has discarded the same on the ground that there was no proper identification.\\n11. Having gone through the records, we find it difficult to be persuaded to take a different view on the evidence against the Appellant which according to both the trial court and the High Court formed an unbroken chain which led only to one hypothesis, viz., the involvement of the Appellant in the offences Under Section 302 and Section 201 Indian Penal Code. It has to be specially noted that even Under Section 313 Indian Penal Code statement, the Appellant did not have any explanation on the presence of human blood stains on her clothes which were duly recovered on her disclosure.\\n12. In \\nNana Keshav Lagad Vs. State of Maharashtra, \\n, this Court had an occasion to consider a similar situation. Since the factual background, as such, is also explained therein, we shall extract the relevant paragraph as such:\\n27. The other submission made on behalf of the Appellants was with reference to the human blood found on the clothes worn by A-1 and A-4. It was contended that the prosecution failed to satisfactorily establish through any independent evidence about the bloodstains found on the clothes of A-1, as well as the Appellant in Crl. A, No. 1010 of 2008. In that respect instead of reiterating the details, it will be sufficient to refer to the conclusion reached by the trial court, while dealing with the said contention, which is found in para 63. The relevant part of it reads as under:\\n63. In the present case, the evidence of API Padwal in this respect is not seriously challenged or shattered. After all the accused were arrested under panchnama and at the time of arrest panchnama of accused Nana bloodstained clothes were seized. It is not in any way contended or for that matter even whispered that IO API Padwal was having any rancour against the accused or he was motivated or interested in one-sided investigation with the sole object of implicating the accused. As a matter of fact, the investigation in this case appears to be totally impartial. When it transpired that two accused by name Sandeep and Ganesh, the juvenile delinquent have not taken part in the assault, their names were deleted from the prosecution case by filing report Under Section 169 Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, here the investigation has proceeded impartially and it is also not even for the sake of it, is suggested to API Padwal that, no such bloodstained clothes were recovered from the accused Nana, moreover, as per the settled position of law, there is no presumption in law that a police officer acts dishonestly and his evidence cannot be acted upon. Therefore, here the evidence of API Padwal is sufficient to prove the recovery of the bloodstained clothes of the accused. His evidence also goes to prove that all these articles, bloodstained clothes, etc. were sent to CA and as per the CA report, Ext. 61 the blood was detected on the clothes of the accused and the deceased and this blood was human blood.... In the present case, though the CA report, Ext. 61 shows that, the said human blood was of Group B, CA report, Ext. 62 about the blood sample of the accused states that the blood group could not be ascertained as the results were inconclusive, moreover, there is no CA of the blood sample of the deceased to prove that he was having Blood Group B. However, the fact remains that, the stains of human blood were found on the clothes of accused Nana and he has not explained how these bloodstains were on his clothes and therefore, as observed in this authority, it becomes one more highly incriminating circumstance against the accused.\\nIn fact, as rightly noted by the trial court, it was for the Appellants to have explained as to how the clothes worn by them contained human blood. In Section 313 questioning, no explanation was forthcoming from the Appellants. In these circumstances, the said contention also does not merit any consideration.\\n13. The last contention is on parity. It is submitted that Udai Lal, whose clothes were duly recovered, also contained stains of human blood, for which also, there was no explanation and he had also given disclosure on the recovery of weapon of offence. Though we find that the acquittal made by the High Court could require a revisit, in view of the fact that there is no appeal by the State against the acquittal of Udai Lal and that the incident is of the year 1999, we do not propose to pursue the matter as against Udai Lal. However, we may state that only because Udai Lal was acquitted, in view of the clinching evidence on the involvement of the Appellant in the offences of murder and destruction of evidence charged against her, she is not entitled for a similar treatment as that of Udai Lal. Merely because one or more of those charged with the substantial offences and also charged Under Section 34 Indian Penal Code have been acquitted, the one in the group who shared the common intention, in whose case there is conclusive evidence of direct involvement, cannot claim parity.\\n14. Thus, we respectfully agree with the concurrent findings on the conviction and sentence of the Appellant. We find no merit in the appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.\\n15. It is brought to our notice that by virtue of the Order dated 09.04.2014 passed by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench, Jaipur in D.B. Civil Writ Petition (Parole) No. 3026 of 2014, the High Court, taking note of the fact that the Appellant had served more than fourteen and a half years of sentence in jail without parole and that she was aged about 79 years, has granted her permanent parole. We make it clear that dismissal of this appeal shall not, in any way, affect either the permanent parole or commutation of her sentence.\\n\"),\n",

These appeals are directed against the common judgment and order of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1174 and 1629 of 2005, dated 11.08.2009. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court has confirmed the order of conviction and sentence for the offence punishable Under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, \"the Indian Penal Code\"), and has confirmed the order of conviction but modified the order of sentence for the offence punishable Under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that early morning on 14.10.1997 the deceased Shobhana committed suicide in her matrimonial home by taking poison. She was taken to the hospital where she was declared to have been brought dead. Thereafter, the father of the deceased lodged a complaint before the police wherein he stated that the husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law of the deceased, who are the Appellants-herein, had subjected her to extreme physical and mental cruelty and thereby compelled her to commit suicide.\\n2. The complainant stated that the deceased had been married for a period of two and a half years at the time of the commission of suicide, and had a ten month old son. Soon after her marriage, the Appellants began to subject her to physical and mental cruelty and harassment. The sister-in-law of the deceased would taunt her. The husband of the deceased would bring home work involving the stitching of buttons, and the Appellants would reprimand the deceased to complete the entire work of stitching buttons within the night. The son of the deceased was only a few months old, and as a result, she would have to attend to him at night, due to which she would be unable to complete the work of stitching buttons. Thereupon, the Appellants would beat her. The sister-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased would not allow the deceased to feed her son. On three occasions, when the deceased visited her maternal home, she narrated the instances of physical and mental cruelty she faced to the complainant.\\n3. On the basis of the complaint a First Information Report was registered for the offences punishable Under Sections 306, 498-A and 114 of the Indian Penal Code. After the completion of investigation charge-sheet was filed. The case was triable exclusively by the Sessions Court and therefore the case was committed to the Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court, Rajkot. Thereafter, the Appellants appeared before the Additional Sessions Judge and after both sides were heard, charges were framed against the Appellants for the offences punishable Under Sections 306 and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. The charges were read over and explained to the Appellants who pleaded not guilty. Accordingly, the case was committed to Trial.\\n4. In order to substantiate the charges framed against the Appellants, the prosecution examined ten witnesses including the complainant, the Medical Officer who conducted post mortem, and panch witnesses and presented twenty one documents. After the completion of prosecution evidence, the statements of the Appellants were recorded Under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short, \"the Code\") wherein they denied all allegations leveled against them. No evidence was led in defense of the Appellants.\\n5. The counsel for the Appellants would submit before the Additional Sessions Judge that the prosecution case suffered from numerous lacunae and failed to establish the guilt of the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The counsel for the Appellants would submit that no complaint about cruelty and harassment had been lodged before the police prior to the suicide of the deceased.\\n6. The counsel for the Appellants would further submit that while the deceased committed suicide prior to 8:45 a.m., the First Information Report was lodged only at 11:30 p.m. and therefore there was unexplained delay in lodging of the First Information Report, and this would raise considerable doubt regarding the genuineness of the complaint. The counsel for the Appellants would further submit that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses suffered from inconsistencies and contradictions, and further that there were no independent witnesses to corroborate their testimonies.\\n7. Upon a detailed examination of the evidence on record, the Additional Sessions Judge held that the charges against the Appellants were proved beyond reasonable doubt. The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were cogent and reliable and did not suffer from any material contradictions. The father, mother and sister of the deceased were natural witnesses, and their testimonies could be relied upon to establish the guilt of the Appellants.\\n8. The Additional Sessions Judge further held that the delay in lodging of First Information Report had been duly explained by the prosecution. The incident occurred prior to 8:45 a.m., thereafter inquest was conducted from 9:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m., thereupon post mortem was conducted on the body of the deceased, after which the body was handed over to the family for cremation. It is only natural that the complaint would be lodged before the police after the last rites were performed. Thus, the Additional Sessions Judge did not find any merit in the arguments raised on behalf of the Appellants.\\n9. Accordingly, by order dated 30.05.2005, the Additional Sessions Judge convicted the Appellants for the offences punishable Under Sections 498-A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code. The Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the Appellants to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year each, and also to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- each, and in default to undergo imprisonment for a period of three months for the offence punishable Under Section 498-A. Further, the Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the Appellants to suffer imprisonment for a period of two years each, and also to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/- each, and in default to undergo imprisonment for a period of three months for the offence punishable Under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, Both sentences were to run concurrently.\\n10. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, the Appellants preferred Criminal Appeal before the High Court. Further, the Respondent-State also preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1629 of 2005 before the High Court for enhancement of sentence imposed on the Appellants by the Additional Sessions Judge.\\n11. Upon a detailed consideration of the evidence on record including the judgment and order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, and also the submissions of the parties, by judgment and order dated 11.08.2009, the High Court confirmed the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Additional Sessions Judge for the offence punishable Under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. Further, while confirming the order of conviction passed by the Additional Sessions Judge for the offence punishable Under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, the High Court was of the view that the sentence imposed by the Additional Sessions Judge was insufficient in view of the gravity of offence. In that view of the matter, the High Court enhanced the sentence for the offence punishable Under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code to rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years each.\\n12. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order passed by the High Court, the Appellants are before us in this appeal.\\n13. We have heard learned Counsels for the parties to the lis.\\n14. The learned Counsel for the Appellants would assail the judgment and order passed by the High Court and submit that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The learned Counsel for the Appellants would inter alia submit that there was unexplained delay of 14 hours in lodging of First Information Report, and this would show that the complaint was lodged as an afterthought with the mala fide intention of harassing the Appellants. The learned Counsel for the Appellants would further submit that no independent witnesses were examined by the prosecution, and the Appellants could not be convicted solely on the basis of the testimonies of interested witnesses.\\n15. The learned Counsel for the Appellants would rely upon Exhibit 24 of the prosecution evidence, a letter written by the deceased prior to her death. The learned Counsel for the Appellants would submit that in the absence of the deceased, this letter should be considered to be her testimony, and nowhere in this letter has she mentioned that she was being subjected to harassment or cruelty by the Appellants. Apart from arguing on merits of the case, learned Counsel for the Appellants would submit that the harsh sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years ought to be reduced.\\n16. Per contra, the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent-State would support the order of conviction and sentence passed by the High Court.\\n17. Having gone through the records of the case including the judgments and orders passed by the Courts below, we are of the considered view that there is no infirmity in the judgment of conviction passed by the High Court for the offences punishable Under Sections 498-A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code which requires our interference.\\n18. Further, in light of the serious nature of the offence involved, we are of the considered view that no occasion arises for reduction of the order of sentence confirmed by the High Court for the offence punishable Under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. However, in our opinion the ends of justice would be met if we reduce the order of sentence passed by the High Court from five years to three years for the offence punishable Under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.\\n19. The Appeals are disposed of accordingly.\\n20. The Appellants are directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence. The order passed by us shall not be treated as precedent in any other case.\\nOrdered accordingly.\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/997332.htm', 'title': ''}, page_content=\"@JUDGMENTTAG-ORDER\\n1. The Appellant-Assessee has a factory at Bamboo Flat, South Andamans and its head office is in Calcutta. The Assessee is manufacturing ply-woods and related products in its factory at South Andamans. Some of these products are sold from the factory premises in South Andamans only to certain buyers. However, major portion of the products manufactured there are sold to other dealers from their numerous depots which are situated at different places in the country. The Assessee had filed its declaration Under [Rule] 173C of the Central Excise Rules showing the price of the goods at which they were sold ex-factory and delivery basis. The Respondent-Revenue found that there was a lot of price difference between the goods sold at ex-factory and delivery basis in comparison with the goods which were sold to the buyers from their depots. Investigation was carried out. Statements of two buyers, viz., Sri Sreeram Tekriwal, partner of M/s. Sreeram Santosh Kumar, Calcutta and Sri Mahendra Laxmidas Panchmati, partner of M/s. Laxmidas Brothers, Bombay were recorded and on that basis, show cause notice dated 3-5-1995 was served upon the Assessee stating as to why the price at which the goods were sold to these customers from the depots may not be the basis for determining the value for the purpose of excise duty. The Respondent contested the aforesaid show cause notice by furnishing its reply wherein various defences/justifications were given. Among others, it was stated that on the same ground, proceedings were taken earlier which resulted in favour of the Assessee by the decision of the Tribunal and that decision of the Tribunal was accepted as no further appeal was filed by the Department there against. The Assessee also questioned the correctness of the statements of the aforesaid two witnesses and demanded right to cross-examine them. The matter was heard. Thereafter, the Adjudicating Authority passed the order confirming the demand in the show cause notice. The Adjudicating Authority also took into consideration the price list of the Assessee maintained at its depots which was treated as the price for the purposes of levying the excise duty. The Appellant filed appeal against the aforesaid order of the Adjudicating Authority. However, this appeal is also been dismissed by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'Tribunal')-The perusal of the order of the Tribunal would demonstrate that it had taken note of the plea specifically raised by the Assessee that the normal ex-factory sale price should be treated as normal price by virtue of the provisions of Section 4 of the Central Excise Act and to which only transportation cost could be added. Number of judgments were cited in support of this proposition which are taken note of by the Tribunal. However, on two grounds, the Tribunal rejected the appeal of the Assessee. These are:-\\n(1) The ex-factory sale was hardly 2 percent and most of the sales, i.e., to the extent of 98 per cent, were from the depots of the Assessee which are situated at other places and not at the place of factory, i.e., South Andamans.\\n(2) Though the price at which sales were made ex-factory at South Andamans remains the same over a period of time as far as sales to depots are concerned, the price increased from time to time.\\n2. Insofar as the plea of the Appellant that it was not allowed to cross-examine the dealers whose statements were relied upon by the Adjudicating Authority in passing the orders, the Tribunal [2006 (205) E.L.T. 831 (Tribunal)] rejected its plea in the following manner:-\\n6. The plea of no cross-examination granted to the various dealers would not help the Appellant case since the examination of the dealers would not bring out any material which would not be in the possession of the Appellant themselves to explain as to why their ex-factory prices remain static. Since we are not upholding and applying the ex-factory prices, as we find them contravened and not normal price as envisaged Under Section 4(1), we find no reason to disturb the Commissioners orders.\\n3. Challenging the aforesaid order, the present appeal is preferred by the Appellant-Assessee.\\n4. We have heard Mr. Kavin Gulati, learned senior counsel appearing for the Assessee, and Mr. K. Radhakrishnan, learned senior counsel who appeared for the Revenue.\\n5. According to us, not allowing the Assessee to cross-examine the witnesses by the Adjudicating Authority though the statements of those witnesses were made the basis of the impugned order is a serious flaw which makes the order nullity inasmuch as it amounted to violation of principles of natural justice because of which the Assessee was adversely affected. It is to be borne in mind that the order of the Commissioner was based upon the statements given by the aforesaid two witnesses. Even when the Assessee disputed the correctness of the statements and wanted to cross-examine, the Adjudicating Authority did not grant this opportunity to the Assessee. It would be pertinent to note that in the impugned order passed by the Adjudicating Authority he has specifically mentioned that such an opportunity was sought by the Assessee. However, no such opportunity was granted and the aforesaid plea is not even dealt with by the Adjudicating Authority. As far as the Tribunal is concerned, we find that rejection of this plea is totally untenable. The Tribunal has simply stated that cross-examination of the said dealers could not have brought out any material which would not be in possession of the Appellant themselves to explain as to why their ex-factory prices remain static. It was not for the Tribunal to have guess work as to for what purposes the Appellant wanted to cross-examine those dealers and what extraction the Appellant wanted from them.\\n6. As mentioned above, the Appellant had contested the truthfulness of the statements of these two witnesses and wanted to discredit their testimony for which purpose it wanted to avail the opportunity of cross-examination. That apart, the Adjudicating Authority simply relied upon the price list as maintained at the depot to determine the price for the purpose of levy of excise duty. Whether the goods were, in fact, sold to the said dealers/witnesses at the price which is mentioned in the price list itself could be the subject matter of cross-examination. Therefore, it was not for the Adjudicating Authority to presuppose as to what could be the subject matter of the cross-examination and make the remarks as mentioned above. We may also point out that on an earlier occasion when the matter came before this Court in Civil Appeal No. 2216 of 2000, order dated 17-3-2005 [2005 (187) E.L.T. A33 (S.C.)] was passed remitting the case back to the Tribunal with the directions to decide the appeal on merits giving its reasons for accepting or rejecting the submissions.\\n7. In view the above, we are of the opinion that if the testimony of these two witnesses is discredited, there was no material with the Department on the basis of which it could justify its action, as the statement of the aforesaid two witnesses was the only basis of issuing the show cause notice.\\n8. We, thus, set aside the impugned order as passed by the Tribunal and allow this appeal. No costs.\\n\")]"
